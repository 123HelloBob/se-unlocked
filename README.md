# Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast

To make the podcast [Software Engineering Unlocked](https://www.se-unlocked.com) more accessible, the podcast needs transcripts. Right now, the transcripts are automatically created, and unfortunately contains quite a few mistakes.

To make the transcripts better, they have to be edited and improved by hand. 
If you want to help make the podcast more accessible, please feel free to pick up any transcript and work through it.

## How to contribute
Transcripts can be improved either while you listen to the epsiodes, or even just be reading through the text and correcting issues that way.
Please remove spelling, grammar and other mistakes that you see. 
**Before starting** to work on an epsiode, please **leave a comment on the issue** indicating that you are going to work on the transcript, to avoid conflicts and duplication of work. 

## Hacktoberfest 
The issues count towards the #Hacktoberfest.
