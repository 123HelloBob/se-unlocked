# Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast

To make the podcast [Software Engineering Unlocked](https://www.se-unlocked.com) more accessible, the podcast needs 
transcripts. Right now, the transcripts are automatically created, and unfortunately contain quite a few mistakes.

To make the transcripts better, they have to be edited and improved by hand. 
If you want to help make the podcast more accessible, please feel free to pick up any transcript and work through it.

## How to contribute
Transcripts can be improved either while you listen to the epsiodes, or even just be reading through the 
text and correcting issues that way.
Please remove spelling, grammar and other mistakes that you see. You can find a short 
guideline on [how to edit the transcripts here](https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked/blob/master/Transcription_Guidelines.md).

**Before starting** to work on an epsiode, please **leave a comment on the issue** indicating that you are 
going to work on the transcript, to avoid conflicts and duplication of work. 

The transcripts are formatted with **line breaks after ~80 chars** max to allow for a better pull request experience. 
It does not affect the (markdown) appearance, i.e., the end result. 
Please try to keep it ~80 chars. Some +/- isn't a big deal, but please do not completely remove it.

Even for transcripts that do not have an active open issue there might be mistakes. If you find problems with one of the 
transcipts, please feel free to open an issue, or directly create a PR with the improvements.
