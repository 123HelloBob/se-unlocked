# Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast

To make the podcast more accessible, the podcast needs transcripts. Right now, the transcripts are automatically created, and unfortunately contain quite a few mistakes.

Whenever I have time, I work through them and improve the transcript. If you want to help make the podcast more accessible, please feel free to pick up any transcript and work through it.

Transcripts can be improved either while you listen to the epsiodes, or even just be reading through the text and correcting issues that way.

The issues also count towards the #Hacktoberfest!
