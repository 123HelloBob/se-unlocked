# Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast

To make the podcast [Software Engineering Unlocked](https://www.se-unlocked.com) more accessible, the podcast needs transcripts. Right now, the transcripts are automatically created, and unfortunately contain quite a few mistakes.

To make the transcripts better, they have to be edited and imroved by hand. 
If you want to help make the podcast more accessible, please feel free to pick up any transcript and work through it.

Transcripts can be improved either while you listen to the epsiodes, or even just be reading through the text and correcting issues that way.

## Hacktoberfest 
The issues count towards the #Hacktoberfest.
