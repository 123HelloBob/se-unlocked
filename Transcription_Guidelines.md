# Guidelines for transcription for accessibility 

1. Include relevant non-text audio such as ( *laugh* ) or ( *gritting teeth* ) in parentheses and italics.

2. Filler words such as 'um', 'like', and stutters may be excluded in order to make the text more intelligible. 

3. Background music/noises do not need to be included unless they are relevant to the spoken audio. ( *intro music* ) and ( *outro music* ) can be denoted.

4. Do not capitalize words, except to express that a speaker is yelling.

5. Identify the speakers.

6. Any unintelligible audio should be denoted with [unintelligible].
