# Transcript Episode Sandeep Panda

**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, dr. McKayla and I open the doors to stop the companies 
and thought leaders around the world. Today. I speak with Sandeep Panda about 
starting a developer community from scratch. He's an entrepreneur on journey, 
remote work and stuff for development practices at a startup.
I'm super thrilled for his awesome third episode. I hope you enjoy it. If you 
like it, support my work by spreading the word. Tell your friends about the 
podcast shared on Twitter and LinkedIn Facebook. I promise how we'll do a happy 
dance each time you do it today. I have the pleasure to talk to Sandy Panda.
The founder and CEO of hash note, a friendly and inclusive developer community 
hash node is a startup fully remote and chest in February to shift it from a Q 
and a side to provide plugin functionality for developers. So there's plenty to 
talk about here, but yeah, let's start at the beginning. Sandeep, you're running 
a developer community.
Are you a developer yourself? 

**Sandeep:** [00:00:59] Thanks for having me McCullough. I'm honored to be here. 
So, uh, yeah. So to answer your question, I am a developer and I love coding. 
And beside that, I'm the founder of the company called  and we are a team of six 
running, a friendly and inclusive community for engineers. 

**Michaela:** [00:01:16] So how did you become a developer?
What was your way or yourself taught developer or did you go to university? So 

**Sandeep:** [00:01:22] I studied computer science for four years, uh, from the 
other nine to 2013. And that kind of, uh, give me the post to become an engineer 
and learn coding. Well, let me start a lot of things in the is I will mostly a 
separate engineer when it comes to using latest technologies and the tools that 
we use right now.
I taught myself all those tools and technologies. 

**Michaela:** [00:01:45] So when you were in college, did you already have that 
urge to start your own company? Or did that just come later? 

**Sandeep:** [00:01:51] When I was in college, I met my cofounder futsal, and 
both of us, you know, we, we divided our tasks, tasks. So I told him that he has 
to do the UX side of things, you know, design things, learn CSS.
And I restricted myself to backend development. So at that point we thought that 
we'll create something cool. So in fact, we did, we, uh, built a bunch of side 
projects. I end up we're running them through the college, but we never had the 
idea of creating a formal company and raising money and, you know, build a full 
hook list business.
And that happened well only after we left the college and we started doing our 
respective day jobs. At that point, we realized that. That we were not meant for 
their jobs. We, we, we should start something of our own and utilize the skill 
sets that we 

**Michaela:** [00:02:40] have. And what was your first age of after 

**Sandeep:** [00:02:43] college? So we studied in the computer science in a 
small town in India, and our protocol is we moved to Mumbai.
And there we, we started puzzled Michael Hunter. He worked in a company called 
cab Gemini, and, and I started as a trainee supper engineer in a company called 
Majesco domestic. We did that for a year, and then we got the idea of creating a 
friendlier community. 

**Michaela:** [00:03:11] And when you started hash node, did you do that full 
time?
Immediately, almost as a side project again. So in addition to your nine to five 
job, 

**Sandeep:** [00:03:20] 2013, I joined the company then, uh, I don't commit 
2014. We started working on national as a part time. We wrote some initial code 
or we got it going and, you know, 50 to 60% rate. Uh, we thought that when we 
take this seriously, at that point, we left the job and left the job and we had 
an, a savings and we thought that we'll do something, we'll utilize those 
savings and we'll build this on our own.
**Michaela:** [00:03:45] So you had this idea of building hash node, this 
friendly community and QA side. Well, I actually read on your blog that you 
asked something on stack overflow, and then you have been shut down. And so this 
is somehow how this whole idea was born. 
**Sandeep:** [00:03:59] Right. 
**Michaela:** [00:04:00] But then, um, then you just get going. So how did you 
decide which technologies to use and, um, how old is community should look like?
And yeah, the whole process actually start. 
**Sandeep:** [00:04:12] At that point, you know, we thought that struggle Khloe 
was being a lot restrictive and people weren't able to ask questions that were 
subjective in nature and open ended questions. So that led us to create, we 
thought that will create a, you know, a more open community that encourages all 
kinds of questions, not just bugs and errors.
You could, you could ask all, all those subjective questions and open ended 
questions basically. So when we started, the choice of tech stack was very 
simple. I was very comfortable using no JS. So we started with node basically, 
and we, and we use a Mongo DB as the database because it was too easy to 
integrate both with node and Mungo.
And we also used jQuery normal JavaScript per templating. We use EDS with all 
these tools. They're just very simple, simple setup. I can say in the old Mongo 
and January, it was that hashtag was made up of at that time. 
**Michaela:** [00:05:08] And did you choose that tech stack because you wanted 
to make progress really fast and because you knew the technologies very well 
from your previous job, then decide projects you build while at university.
**Sandeep:** [00:05:20] So when we, when we started according, when, when we 
decided that we'll create something like this, we want it to move really fast 
and we wanted to build a prototype and tested and pelted the idea for that. I 
thought that it was type two. A go, which technologist I was familiar with. So, 
so that we could build something really, really fast and get it polluted by the 
customers.
So that, that's why we chose nudges. And I just said, I had, uh, experienced 
with modern Mungo working, working different days of, and Cypress that they 
built. So it was the natural choice. 
**Michaela:** [00:05:54] Okay. Very cool. So you've wrote that. And then what 
was the next step? So how much functionality did you actually build into the 
first product and how did you validate it then?
**Sandeep:** [00:06:06] The initial product name was not Hashanah. It was 
something called they've Meg. So we thought that it's a magazine for depth. So 
we'll call it the banker IO and we launched the super early review. So we 
launched the product and, uh, at that point we were staying in Mumbai. So. Well, 
what we thought was, uh, we'll move to a different city called Bangalore in 
India.
So the city, the city was the it's called the Silicon Valley of India, you know, 
so you could easily access mrs. Industries and cost and talk to a lot of tickets 
general. So we, we lost the early preview of passionate and we immediately 
started to Bangalore and here we came in touch with Axel. So, so we had sorted 
them this initial prototype, and we told them that I quick, we lost that on, but 
a country got more than 200 boards and we got, yeah, lots of comments, feedback, 
and early adopters.
So at that point we made actual partners and we sold them the product. And we 
told them that we would like to raise money is money. And bill take this full 
time. So, yeah, that's, that's how it happened. 
**Michaela:** [00:07:18] And this sounds like really exciting time. So you're 
building this product and you're launching it and then you're also moving across 
the country and then you want to get this really important from excellent to 
invest.
Can you tell me a little bit more about Oechsler. 
**Sandeep:** [00:07:35] So axil is the investor. So they have invested in, in 
companies like Facebook, but miso lots of companies. So we went to them to raise 
capital food is seed money to build this platform 
**Michaela:** [00:07:46] was excellent. The first firm that you asked for money 
and pitched your idea, or did you try somewhere else as well?
**Sandeep:** [00:07:53] Yes. So even before we, we changed the city kind of 
thought that we will raise money from axle because we will get pan up the 
companies funded back. So. So we thought that the, um, our best bet would be to 
approach Axel and see if they're interested. And luckily we, uh, when we moved 
to this new city, uh, there, we met somebody who was, uh, funded by excellent.
And we worked with him for a brief period of two months and we helped him build 
his company and then he introduced us to excellence. And that's how we, that's 
how we got in touch with Axel. 
**Michaela:** [00:08:30] Okay. That's really smart. So you really researched 
sort off your investors and, you know, the background of them and know that 
they're interested in companies like the one that you're actually building.
And then you got your way in, through another company that has access to them. 
Very cool. But, uh, was it sort of a smooth ride from there? Or have there been 
some ups and downs to actually get the money from the firm? When 
**Sandeep:** [00:08:57] you're trying to raise money, it, uh, it takes time. It 
takes time to convince people it's going to be big.
So I took us, uh, a month or so about a month to convince them, to envision us. 
So, so at that time we used to, uh, wonder if they're really going to invest or 
not, but it happened eventually. And when it happened at that time, they gave us 
a pre office space and we could, and we went to that office space and we started 
recruiting and slowly started using the money.
**Michaela:** [00:09:28] So you make it pitch, then you go there, you tell them 
about your community, about your dreams, about your vision. And then a month 
goes by and, um, they just think, or, or you ping them and well, you say you're 
really cool. You should do. 
**Sandeep:** [00:09:44] Okay. Yeah. So I'll just walk you through it. So when 
you go and meet a partner at a VC firm, you will know from the first meeting 
that they're going to invest or not, they're not interested to the first 
meeting.
You will probably not hear from them and most business. They'll probably tell 
you that this is not something they're looking for. But when I guess the sort of 
interest, the access questions, you know, difficult, difficult questions, like 
why do we think people will use our product and why we think we are going to be 
a big company and numbers, stats, all those they asked in the first meeting and 
they give us a week or two to think about the questions and come for the next 
meeting.
Right? So when this, when they say comparative next meeting, it means they're 
industry. They just want to make sure that we are able to think we're able to 
think and we're able to convince them why we are the company that they should 
invest in. Yeah. So the first meeting led to the second and second led to third.
So in, in that, so those three, two to four meetings took about a month, but it 
happened eventually. 
**Michaela:** [00:10:50] So, yeah, three to four meetings. And it's you and your 
cofounder did that, tried to convince them that your product is going well and 
well, before that you launch it actually on product hand and got early adopters, 
do you have an idea how many people were on dev mag at that point?
**Sandeep:** [00:11:07] So at that point, we got about 2000 sign up in that week 
alone, 2000 people signed up on the platform and subsequently people started 
creating accounts, started asking questions and slowly, instead of the number 
was good growing at the rate of 20% per week. That's when we knew that we should 
take it more seriously.
**Michaela:** [00:11:27] Okay. Very cool. And then you said they are creating 
accounts and they're starting these captions on their platform. Did you 
facilitate a lot there as well? So, um, did you go and create questions and 
answers or how did you kickstart the whole thing? Because I imagine, especially 
at the beginning, it's sort of empty and what people need, something that they 
can find there.
Do you need some community? So how, how did you start that? 
**Sandeep:** [00:11:54] We initially started the community. I myself asked a lot 
of questions myself and I answered them. I still can't serve them. And I didn't 
really actually have some questions that I didn't know about. And I invited all 
those people who signed up to answer those questions.
And whenever somebody asked a question, I always answered that, answer the 
question, even if I didn't know about it, I researched that the question and I 
will find a solution and I, I will try to be helpful and provide them an answer. 
But when we hired our teammates, all of us had to, you know, be super active on 
the community.
And curious if you want to ask questions and whenever there was a question, 
right. All of us strive to be helpful and reassess the question and provide an 
answer. That person gets satisfied. That person, it comes back again. Whenever 
he has a question. So that look that took a lot of efforts and you can say, uh, 
our data was less coding.
**Michaela:** [00:12:50] Yeah. Yeah. That's what I imagined. Yeah. So you had 
quite a stable system at that point. So your focus was really on building the 
community and not the system anymore. 
**Sandeep:** [00:13:00] Yeah. So at that point, we, we thought that if we just 
give a building new features or keep developing. No one is going to come and use 
the platform.
They won't care if you're building, if you're doing this using node JS or Java, 
they just need people's would get value out of the community. And that's how 
they will come back to you again and again and again. So we made it our, we made 
it our motto to do community management actively and grow the community and put 
more focus on the community rather than the, uh, other than thinking about tech 
or building new features.
**Michaela:** [00:13:34] Yeah, that makes sense. So I imagine that you have this 
company and it's you and your cofounder, and then you want to hire your first 
employee. Was that a community manager or who was your first employee? 
**Sandeep:** [00:13:46] Yeah. So for the first few years we didn't have even had 
a community manager or marketer. We thought that we are developers and we could 
be the best company to manage it, the best marketers and ambassadors for our 
community.
So all the developers that we hired, we did the job of community manager. Part 
time. We wrote code the division of the time, but we did community management, 
70% of the time, all the developers. 
And 
**Michaela:** [00:14:09] how did you find them? I mean, for startup, it's 
sometimes hard to find good talent. So how did you find your first employees?
**Sandeep:** [00:14:17] Initially we utilized AngelList. So, and then this was 
quite good at that time I was free. So we posted some jobs and we, we also 
reached out to a few candidates that we thought are going to be a good fit. So 
we talked to them and increment from AngelList. We had a lot of success in 
Sydney and we had really good engineers from there.
**Michaela:** [00:14:37] It's several years. Now, since you started just still 
have the same employees, or did you have some churn at your company? Uh, we 
**Sandeep:** [00:14:44] took a detour in 2017. We thought that we'll create, um, 
we've transformed hashcode into a blockchain based community. So we did, we 
spent an entire year building blockchain Bish reward system, but that didn't 
materialize.
And at that point we had to change the structure and the team a bit. So, but 
what, at that point, uh, we had to restrict to the company. 
**Michaela:** [00:15:10] Does this mean that some people left the company and 
you had to have, 
**Sandeep:** [00:15:14] yeah. Some people left and we, we thought that we'll 
create, we'll hire people we'll work on the blockchain.
That's when we, in fact hired our first community manager. And we thought that 
will take a lot of effort to manage a blockchain specific community. So we 
started to set the team in that direction, but in the end that didn't happen. 
But the good part is that we hired a bunch of good people and we didn't do 
blockchain, but they're still with us.
**Michaela:** [00:15:42] So when you say it's a blockchain community, is that a 
QA side? That's all about understanding the blockchain or what is the blockchain 
community? How can imagine? 
**Sandeep:** [00:15:53] So at that point we were thinking that people were 
setting their knowledge for free. What we decided to do was we wanted to reward 
people for writing answers and asking good questions, and we couldn't do that 
using a real, real currency.
So instead we thought that we'll put, we'll put all the QA, all the questions on 
a public blockchain. And we'll use our own custom tokens. Like, you know, people 
there, Bitcoin Ethereum at that point. So we heard that we'll get there own 
currency. We'll get our own token on digital token and use that to reward people 
for asking good questions and writing answers.
So that was, that was the goal. 
**Michaela:** [00:16:27] That makes sense. And why did that fall apart? I mean, 
it's a good idea. So how did it fall? 
**Sandeep:** [00:16:34] That's a good idea. Uh, at that point we even built an 
entire blockchain and our question of blockchain and we were about to open 
source that thing. But the problem was that, uh, being a blockchain company or 
we would have tried to raise money.
And people were doing ICS, but at that point it was initial coin offering just 
like IPO. It was initial offering, but it was coins. So, but what, what happened 
is that when we were ready, almost ready, the market just crashed and no one 
was. Was interested in digital tokens because lots of rules and regulations of 
government rules.
For example, in India, you couldn't get your favorite clients are idiots or you 
couldn't fit any custom tokens. So that led to market pricing. And we didn't 
think that it was the right time to raise money under blockchain project. So 
that's when we that's, when we thought that we'll stop this. For now, and we'll 
look into any other ways of building this community and taking this forward.
And that's when we thought about the blog and we put the blockchain thing on 
hold and we kind of went ahead with DevLog because we believe more that 
**Michaela:** [00:17:46] angle, actually another sort of people from your 
company. Right? So from these Q and A's style website to blogging functionality 
for developers. So how is that going?
**Sandeep:** [00:17:59] Okay. So when we start that we'll put blocking on hold. 
At that point, we thought we were constantly thinking of how we can bring more 
palliative the platform, how we can give more value to our users. So at that 
point, many people were complaining about medium. How medium is a. Putting their 
content under pay well, and people they're not happy with it.
And that was the key thing that we taught and we thought that will create the 
blog. And in the last year, or we did, we went about it. We sort of, uh, you 
know, let it grow organically. We in facilities restrict to people, ourselves. 
We told them that we are building something cool. Would you like to migrate from 
medium or your personal blog to their blog?
Then we kind of to remain like that for a month before opening it for everyone. 
Right now we have unlocked personal blogs for around 5,000 people. And it's 
growing steadily and we're getting a lot of support from Twitter. And lots of 
people are writing about us and people are happy with it and people are helping 
us build it.
And we're quite happy. We're quite happy with the way it's going on. 
**Michaela:** [00:19:09] And did you raise money for that as well? 
**Sandeep:** [00:19:12] Raised another 400 K for this part building this thing. 
So in total we have a million dollars. 
**Michaela:** [00:19:18] What's your vision for that blog? What should be the 
end result? 
**Sandeep:** [00:19:22] What we believe is that everyone in the world, every 
developer in the world should have a personal blog.
And they shouldn't be giving away their content for free to other platforms, 
which put it under the pay well or benefit from it. So I'm constantly thinking 
about Mondays and how we can help developers make money from their blog and how 
they can wander the skills. 
**Michaela:** [00:19:42] And for some of the monetization strategies that you 
brainstorm, is that a blockchain coming back.
**Sandeep:** [00:19:48] I don't think blockchain is coming back. Anytime soon 
will try to do this without blockchain, because that will be simpler. Lockton 
comes into our baggies. It will again, sit down, focus to other things like 
legal things. Uh, the military, all those things. Uh, we will be much better at 
doing this with our blockchain.
So 
**Michaela:** [00:20:07] for all of these B  well, from the QA side to the 
blockchain, and then to the Def blocks, there's a lot of development involved. 
Have you still been able to keep this 70, 30 split between development and 
community management, or did that change in that time where you made, for 
example, the decision to go for this blockchain?
**Sandeep:** [00:20:26] When we decided to do blockchain at that point, it was 
like a hundred percent quoting all the time. We, we didn't provide the 
necessarily conceptual rational at that point for a period of six months. And, 
uh, that was a mistake we should have given more to consent to hashtag and 
maintain the balance there.
But instead we went pull on the blockchain and we spent a lot of time reading 
the blockchain rather than the building of the community. So, um, That was 
there, but when we gradually moved away from blockchain and started doing DevLog 
at the front, we again, uh, regained the balance. We again started managing the 
community, actively growing the community actively.
And we developed for about 50% of the 60% time we did development to get that at 
the blog out. And the 40% of the time we, we least went to the community and 
with Amos and talked to the people and started growing. 
**Michaela:** [00:21:19] Basically you are talking about the trade off between 
being really fast with development versus still growing your community.
**Sandeep:** [00:21:25] Exactly. Yeah. 
**Michaela:** [00:21:26] Okay. And in the six months that you stopped attending 
so much to your community, did you see a drop in users or questions or what 
happened? Because you said that you are a little bit regretting, that you did 
not focus too much on the community. 
**Sandeep:** [00:21:40] Yes. So in those six months, when we were doing 
blockchain, we did development most of the time and we didn't manage the 
community properly.
And there were several implications of that. Although we don't, we didn't lose a 
lot of users or we were acquiring. What is as a de facto date and being a VC 
backed company, we should have grown at a rate of 20% we can be, but that wasn't 
happening because when putting a lot of efforts there to drive the community 
growth, but we didn't lose a lot of features, but the community.
Right. When you, when you would come to the community, you will know that there 
were people who were taking the privacy policy and the code of conduct for 
granted. So we were a friendly and inclusive community, but there were some 
people who were taking advantage of it and they were, you know, constantly 
passing people and they were very civil in their discussions.
And we didn't do a lot of things at the time because we are too much occupied 
with blockchain. We didn't have a lot of time dealing with those kinds of. 
People. So ultimately that put a lot of people off and with Nolan of the 
friendly community. And as soon as we realized that that was happening and we 
were thinking to put blocks in away that point we regained the control and we 
started managing it actively.
You know, we enforce the code of conduct, bring more efforts to grow the 
community, such as this, we started again, which I've been doing. Amy's Amy was 
one of the powerful. Aspects of passionate people that really love as many 
things as, since we started doing those, those again. And we started enforcing 
the code of conduct and we, again, sat there and gazing with the community.
Those are the things that we started doing. 
**Michaela:** [00:23:18] Yeah. Well that sounds like up and downs and really a 
lot of learnings right there. That's the VC firm. Give you some feedback on that 
as well. Or do they look over your shoulder somehow? What's the relationship 
**Sandeep:** [00:23:30] there? We meet them twice a month and we saw them, our 
numbers, our stats, and the progress that we have made.
And they ask us questions, like what's the current challenge and how is the team 
stepping up and, and what we should do in order to, in order to go big and all 
those questions, basically. So basically we were working sort of, sort of, sort 
of, if you have any, if, if we need any help hiring or if you need any, any 
different, we can go and ask them about it.
And, uh, and they're always providing feedback, providing support. And now it's 
beyond money right now. And if we have any questions, concerns, they're helping 
us there. Isn't too much interference from their side. You know, you can call it 
a good partnership. Say very good assistance. Do 
**Michaela:** [00:24:17] you have to actively see from, for permissions for big 
changes that you want to make?
**Sandeep:** [00:24:22] Yes. So if there's a big chance such as wing on 
blockchain or open sourcing, certain parts we talked to in advance, we tell them 
that we're thinking this way and we are printing off. We're doing all these 
changes and we take there, we tell them that, do they have any questions or they 
are so experienced.
They have, they have run a lot of companies. They are, they see lots of 
companies day in and day out. Whenever you give them a suggestion or. You pit 
something for them, they will ask you questions. And that itself is a big win. 
There you'll know that what you're doing is correct or not. And you'll get a 
chance to think more about it.
Dig deeper into the subject and really think about whether your, what they're 
doing is correct or not. So that's the plan when we do a big generous, and, and 
if it's not so much so big,  we take the decision ourselves. 
**Michaela:** [00:25:17] Okay. So as you described, I mean, I imagine this, we 
see firms sort of like, well, your personal consultant that looks over your 
shoulder and has a lot of knowledge and can provide a lot of value to you.
Well, probably mostly related to them product itself through the, I have 
opinions about the software development side of the project. For example, let's 
say best practices you should follow, or which technologies you should use. 
**Sandeep:** [00:25:42] No. So, uh, they don't talk much about development. Now. 
It's more of a business side of things.
It's more about how do we raise more money? How do we hire a good team? How do 
we go big? How do we monetize the platform? All those angles. Well, that 
**Michaela:** [00:25:58] makes really sense because, well, they have like the 
business background and they have the knowledge and the insights, as you said, 
into all these companies.
And so they can share it with you and from the developer side, well, you are the 
experts. Do you feel like an expert? 
**Sandeep:** [00:26:14] So sometimes I feel really good about myself and a lot 
of times I think, I don't know. I don't know anything. So that's how I like 
developer is at times you feel like you're the God I have some of the time you 
think that you don't know anything.
So that's happened a lot with me, but generally if you ask me, I still think 
that I don't know a lot of things. I know a specific things. And I'm good at a 
specific technologist. And if you ask them to build something, I can build it, 
but I'm in no way an expert. So I still think that I can get a company running 
and build good products, but they're far more experienced developers than me 
write better code than me who writes a build to purchase than me and I.
And every day is a new learning system for me and personally, I have to grow a 
lot. 
**Michaela:** [00:27:05] And so when you look at your decisions that you made 
from a technical side of your project, which ones do you think were really good 
decisions and which were the smart things that you are proud of and you say, 
well, that's what I think we did really well.
**Sandeep:** [00:27:19] Yeah. So the best his son was relating passionate in. 
Next year. So that is something next year. Uh it's it really makes things really 
easy if you're using modern tools.  but that's that those are the tools that 
those are the technologies that you're using. You should probably be using next 
year. So in May, 2017, we rewrote hashtags in next years and probably the best 
assistant that it took to reduce the development time, deployment time, 
everything.
I recommend everyone to do that. If they are using monster. 
**Michaela:** [00:27:56] Well, that sounds like a big commitment. So how did you 
decide to say we are going to do a rewrite right here and how much of the code 
base was actually read written at that point? 
**Sandeep:** [00:28:08] So moving to next year, this is a matter of sending the 
UI because next year you have node.
So we have good preserved all those backend code that we had. And we just had to 
write the front end components, that process, the leapt out a lot of. Unused 
components on news pages and we could report it. Only the things that we are 
going to go ahead with. It is not a very difficult task. It took about a couple 
of weeks to write all those components in next day.
And it, and it has worked like a champ for us. After that we could make tenders 
faster. We could deploy really fast and next this team has been releasing new 
updates once in a while. And they're really, really good at what they're doing. 
It was a very good the system as for me. 
**Michaela:** [00:28:53] So, how does your development process in general look 
like, do you do testing or do you do code reviews?
How does it look like 
**Sandeep:** [00:29:02] in our team we have four developers and we always make 
sure to write unit tests and tests for critical components. So we use something 
called Cyprus, right? You do tests. And all of us are when we are building a 
feature or a particular component, we make sure to unit test, deck, and ACR.
We do this basic things. We, we always use to protect ourselves when we build 
it. We test all the cases, all the different scenarios. And we make sure that 
whatever we build, we use it and test them properly before setting. Once we are 
confident about it, once we know that, or there's a passing and we have 
destroyed everything we, uh, submit for peer review.
So let's say, uh, our team is Guinness, is working on something. And once he has 
confronted about it, he submits pier will request and get up. And then one of 
what the mix goes there and the reviews, the internet. And if we have any 
comments, if you have any, any studies feedback, we leave it on the theater 
itself.
You talk about, you talk about my stool for living the core and see the dips. 
And we use that to review the code and provide our citizens feedback. And we 
then request genders. If any, and the developer then has another look at the 
code and they explained why they took that particular approach, or they simply 
resolve the problem.
If I identified and once we were all happy, we just, we just was sit to 
production and the CACD tool takes care of everything 
**Michaela:** [00:30:40] else. And so there is at least one person that looks 
through. 
**Sandeep:** [00:30:44] Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. 
**Michaela:** [00:30:46] And it doesn't matter who that is. So if that person 
says it looks fine to me, then you can actually push that.
**Sandeep:** [00:30:52] Yes. So most of the times it's me. I reviewed the, I 
make sure that I review all the, all the pull requests, but if, what if I, if am 
not available for some reason, Um, then they can just do the review and puts it 
to paper and, uh, make sure that they're observing the future, that any books 
they're available to fix it.
So 
**Michaela:** [00:31:11] when you push it to production, then the monitor what's 
going on with the community. And if there are any backs, then they would revert 
the change. Or how does the process look like? 
**Sandeep:** [00:31:22] Well, so for most of the times we don't encounter a lot 
of critical bugs on the production. We have a lot of times we identified them 
before deploying and on some occasions, if there are any books, uh, after this 
happened, after the deployment, sometimes we revert those changes or we send a 
fix with quickly after testing and that solves the problem.
**Michaela:** [00:31:41] So if I encounter a problem as a user, how would I 
report that? 
**Sandeep:** [00:31:45] So we have multiple ways to report one for the first way 
is to, you know, create a new issue on our get beds. We have a separate report 
on GitHub, a public report where they can raise it so they can do that. 
Otherwise they can directly BME.
And, and, and third way is to talk to us on discord. So if they're a member of 
our digital channel, they can directly communicate with us and talk to us in 
real time. I report bugs, get feedback. 
**Michaela:** [00:32:15] Yeah. I wanted to ask you something about reliability. 
So do you look into that in particular, like side reliability issues?
Do you have a person that really tries to be an expert for that, or also for 
security related issues? 
**Sandeep:** [00:32:30] So right now we are a small team of, for people in the 
dev team. So right now it's just me, uh, who looks after the reliability and 
security issues. So I always wanted things and use different tools to make sure 
that the site is not, is not unreliable.
And the site is not down. The first one is we use a tool called epics. That does 
template things, the website and notifies all of a sudden the score translate 
that site is a little bit down. There is an interesting latency. If reports, 
things like that, then we use new Relic and, uh, uh, key metrics to make sure 
that the performance of the update site is up to the Mark.
And it has not been good. Those are the two things that helped me the most and 
regarding security users, we encourage people to email us about security 
vulnerabilities. Uh, send me, send us a message on discord. And there've been 
many instances where people have reached out to us over email with security and 
security vulnerabilities, and we have all this pitch them.
And we also want them with some passionate and an imagine gift cards. And so, so 
yeah, so I'm the one who looks up all those things. 
**Michaela:** [00:33:48] So your strategy is to encourage you users. Well, I 
guess, especially the ones probably that are interested insecurity to think 
about ways you could attack hash node or Wilner abilities that are defined, and 
then they send you those via email and let you know about that.
**Sandeep:** [00:34:05] Exactly. Yeah. Oh, 
**Michaela:** [00:34:07] yeah, that's really smart. 
**Sandeep:** [00:34:08] Yeah. People like there are people, people who always 
think to think of it, things who want to test things out and we encourage them 
to do that and report to us so that we can kick them on you or them. Cool. 
**Michaela:** [00:34:20] Well, so probably those are always the same people. So, 
you know, the 10 people that are really interested in the ad and the tenders.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Okay, great. Something else. I wanted to talk a little bit 
more about this testing. So you say you're investing in testing and you're doing 
unit integration and some manual testing before you send the code, even for the 
code review. But do you ride the test before you start development?
So in a test driven development fashion, or well, is there some methodology 
around it or is that up to everybody on the team to decide. 
**Sandeep:** [00:34:58] We're pretty flexible when it comes to a metrology, each 
one of us to just that pace. If someone thinks that they have to really follow 
Trinity, they do it. And others from the team, they might not feel comfortable 
with D so they, they make sure to build the future.
And once they are confident that I test for that. But the end result is that 
when the submit the peer, there has to be some tests and this should be 
concerned about it. And we're not too much worried about or focused on the 
material that they follow 
**Michaela:** [00:35:32] and you have something like good coverage. Um, so you 
know, what part of the code is covered?
Uh, do you use metrics like that? 
**Sandeep:** [00:35:40] We don't have metrics on the good governance. Uh, we, 
what we do is we. We make sure that the critical functionalities working 
critical functionalities are tested after. For example, the user onboarding sign 
up resist, push gears, and a response creates some reactions. All of them are 
working or not.
And if they're working and I, that's fine, if all of them were working, then 
we're good to go. And we make sure that the new features they are, they have 
unit tests and it is where right now we are, we are not measuring the core 
coverage number. But I, but I think we should start doing that once we go ahead 
a little bit with the, the blood thing, uh, we will do all those things.
We'll start with numbers and competence score. And 
**Michaela:** [00:36:27] do you have like other studying analysis tools that you 
run over your code base? Yes. 
**Sandeep:** [00:36:32] So, Oh, we used to use Eastland heavily before, uh, 
before doing the blockchain thing. Then after, after that, we kind of stopped 
that and they're going to reintroduce yes.
Link very soon, probably in the coming week. 
**Michaela:** [00:36:45] And why did you stop it? 
**Sandeep:** [00:36:46] We did blockchain at that time. We were pretty much 
focused on bill, the actual blockchain thing and launched our own token. And we 
were not so much focused on the style guide. Um, because we are, we're not using 
our, our regular technologies, like Northern oil.
We're using good language at the time and go is a very easy language to start 
with. And we were too much focused on, uh, sipping the production and worrying 
about the content and all. So, so, so at that point we disabil Eastland. I know 
we're a hashtag core. And we started building the blockchain. The, after we came 
back from the blockchain, we decided that we're going to focus on the deadlock, 
mr.
So at that point, uh, we thought that not going to have your slant right now, 
but we'll follow the pattern of it. Delegate. We'll make sure that we're 
following patterns and good standards. And at some point when we are confident 
and we have, uh, built something, uh, something that people love, I will 
introduce something like Islam to make sure that whoever is any of the team that 
they're following the same pattern.
So, 
**Michaela:** [00:38:00] is this your way of reducing the overhead value? Just 
figuring out the features and what the product is. 
**Sandeep:** [00:38:05] Right. It's a very small team, a small team, and we have 
done multiple pivots. So we always think that how we can do things effectively 
and faster and introduce something like Eastland. I think it's a really good 
thing to do do so, uh, right now, as we have grown a little bit, I think a side 
time to do something like yesterday, uh, make sure we are sticking to standards.
**Michaela:** [00:38:27] Yeah. Yeah, I see that. So one of the things that I 
wanted to talk with you about is that you are running a remote company and also 
people on Twitter were asking about that. So a little bit before you told me 
about the offices that you actually got with the VC funding. So apparently you 
have offices, but you're also remote or don't you have the offices anymore.
What's the story behind that? We 
**Sandeep:** [00:38:51] got a office space for free for me, this money. And we 
used office space for, for nearly four years only the recently we went with the 
remote team and we still have the office with us, but we don't go there. Don't 
go. There we go. Fully remote, um, with two of our members from Europe and we, 
we are very happy with the way it has worked out for us.
So, uh, but when we want to meet, uh, for example, when my cofounder and I want 
to meet, we just met in a conference, R a I in a nearby area. We make very 
rarely, very rarely for that. And I go to the office, the three of us 
specifically I've got, and we always, um, collaborate on the, uh, on the remote 
site. And we, I can swallow really, really, really well.
**Michaela:** [00:39:41] And why did you decide to go from being two people in 
an office to hiring all over the word and remotely, 
**Sandeep:** [00:39:47] after running high for four years, we realized that you 
shouldn't rely on, on a particular geographical area to find the best talent you 
can. You can find talent from all over the world. And if you're restricting 
yourself to a particular area, then you are missing out on it.
A lot of good people and we a second looking for good people from all over the 
world. And he said that we were, we're going to build a remote team and we are 
not going to keep looking for people in, in one particular area. So that made us 
rethink this way of working a little bit. And I read a book hook called remote 
from DHS from base camp.
So I got inspired. I got inspired and I. I thought that that's a really, really 
cool way of working helps you immensely. So as soon as they finished the book, I 
was sold and thinking in this new direction and we, uh, so we didn't start, 
started going door. Yes. And we built that team remotely. Yeah, 
**Michaela:** [00:40:48] I'm a big remote advocate.
I've been working remotely since years now and I love it. But when you made this 
shift to remote work, did you see that you had to make changes in the way you 
are working or some of your tooling or your development process? 
**Sandeep:** [00:41:04] So when we finished the more team, we thought that 
things have to be documented in a central location and.
For that we shattered using Basecamp best can, we can collaborate really easily 
with a remote team. So that was the primary change that we did. And then we made 
sure that we are communicating often and communicating in an effective way. So, 
and we use all the tools like Slack, Google Hangouts, and good old email to, uh, 
communicate with each other and be in sync and we will, and we also make sure 
that we have all of us have a good internet connection and we have access to 
good mic on your uniforms.
**Michaela:** [00:41:47] So have you met your two European employees already? 
Did you meet them face to face before the hiring decision or was the whole 
process completely remote? 
**Sandeep:** [00:41:57] Everything was completely more true. I've never met them 
in person. 
**Michaela:** [00:42:00] Oh, that must be funny. 
**Sandeep:** [00:42:02] Yeah. So, so yeah, so initially it was a bit weird. We 
had never had like that, but then everything fell into place and it has worked 
out really well.
So yeah. Now it seems numbers, 
**Michaela:** [00:42:14] especially remote work is really built up on trust. So 
I can imagine that at the beginning you have to put a lot of stress forward. So 
how was that? 
**Sandeep:** [00:42:23] When I first met our first remote employee? Uh Milica 
right. Well got 30 minutes too. One hour, I got the vibe, I got good vibes and 
she has been the community member of  for nearly three to four years.
And she loved the platform that much. She had a lot of good ideas, lots of new 
thinking, and we decided that we're going to work together. 
**Michaela:** [00:42:46] So you say it's really a gut feeling and that if it's 
clicking, there's automatically trust. 
**Sandeep:** [00:42:52] Exactly. 
**Michaela:** [00:42:52] Yeah. I liked that. I liked that a lot. So one of the 
other things I wanted to talk with you about is your dev ops and your deployment 
strategy, has everybody access and the right to deploy to production, or is 
there some specific process you follow?
So 
**Sandeep:** [00:43:08] our dev team is core people. And what we do is everyone 
has access whose to master, which will trigger deployment. But we have ruled 
that no one does that apart from me. So whenever I'm available, I'm the person 
who. Was a stoop master and everyone, they have their own branches, they have 
their feature wrenches.
And once they're confident, they just submit a pull request and get up and I 
review it or someone else revisit. And once we are all confident, I was that 
with motto and I can go to the deployment, but if I'm not available, for some 
reason, someone else from the team takes over and they take care of reviewing 
Mazin and posting to master.
**Michaela:** [00:43:50] Do you have a specific time that you deploy to the 
production? I imagine hash node is used all over the world. So there isn't 
really a perfect time, like say in the middle of the night to actually do the 
pushes. So do you just deploy whenever 
**Sandeep:** [00:44:04] there's no specific time? Actually, when we think that 
we have built, we have picked up a bunch of things and we think.
We should proceed as soon as possible. We do it quickly, nearly zero downtime 
deployment that we have. So there is no reason it, so one, but one thing that we 
make sure is we don't deploy on Fridays. 
**Michaela:** [00:44:25] And also not on weekends. I guess one of the things 
that I've talked with another startup founder recently was about technical debt.
And he said, well, our company is now four years old. So you can imagine how 
much tainting debt we just have from the technology that changed. Do you 
experience that as well? 
**Sandeep:** [00:44:42] I think we have our peer set of technical depth. Uh, we 
have a bunch of code that was written a long back and okay. They need effector, 
but right now we are too much focused on.
Sipping the book and making this the best platform for bloggers. So right now we 
have, we're not doing a lot of cleanup work. Uh, we, we are not respecting the 
old horse and fixing those things, but we had that thing in our, on our. Mine. 
And once we grow a little bit in size, once we sip a few more decks and once we 
have some time, I will probably go back to the old way of doing things and will 
it affect those things and make it better 
**Michaela:** [00:45:24] seeing right now it's really about finding product 
market fit and making the best product.
But do you have some processes or tools that help you to not introduce new 
technical debt? 
**Sandeep:** [00:45:35] All of us. We, we stick to convince us. So we have a 
specific way of bringing things and we always make sure that we are sticking to 
it. And the best practices and a style guide, we'll do that in place. So that 
prevents us from sipping a bad code or patches.
And as I said, we work in a very relaxed way. We don't have had, we don't have 
hard deadlines that makes it enough that you get a lot of time to do, to give it 
proper torque. And you, you, you design features, uh, within a span of. One week 
or two weeks. So you're not constrained by time. So you will. So most of the 
times we do a good job rather than Apache work.
We try not to introduce a new technical depth this way. 
**Michaela:** [00:46:22] So you say you're having no hard deadlines. Would you 
describe your way of working sort of an agile way of working? Do you do stand 
ups and well, do you follow some sort of methodology for your day to day work? 
It's not 
**Sandeep:** [00:46:35] politically as well, but we do daily stand ups for a 
pretend, 15 minutes.
All of us come online and we do it Google Hangouts, call where we talk about 
what we did yesterday and where we're going to do today. So that's what we do. 
And we communicate with each other or Slack and discord, and we make sure that 
everyone is in sync. So we take bugs from guitar and take features from.
Peter declares books and protects them on, on a weekly basis. And we, we had 
stopped that lens, not hard ones give separate lens, and we make sure that we 
are meeting them so that we can know that this thing is expected to be done in a 
week. But for some reason it doesn't happen. We review it and we, again, set a 
deadline and we see, we see that gets finished soon.
So if 
**Michaela:** [00:47:26] you would hire right now, let's say two out other 
people, what would their roles be? 
**Sandeep:** [00:47:31] I think we'll, we might take help of a full placed 
product manager who will constantly look at the metrics stats and drive all the 
efforts to them. So right now it's me and futsal who looks up to the stats and 
metrics.
But if you, if we have a dedicated person who owns that park, that will be 
really good. What metrics 
**Michaela:** [00:47:53] and stats would that be? What's your key metric that 
you think helps you go in the right direction? 
**Sandeep:** [00:47:59] So we track a lot of things. Basically the key things 
will be a number of blocks there. I'm looking for a week.
And number of people, writing posts, adding stories per week and monthly active 
bloggers, weekly active bloggers and monthly active users on hashtag . And how 
are they retained on a week on week? This is at the being at the dropping off in 
the for four weeks. And if a hundred people sign up today, how many are 
retained?
How many come back after four weeks? There are the few key things that we are 
measuring right 
**Michaela:** [00:48:33] now. So, how do you learn? I mean, apart from that, 
that has started, you probably are constantly learning, but all the new problems 
you have to solve, but do you have also some dedicated times set aside for you 
and your teammates for learning or experimenting?
And is there some budget that people can spend on like books or 
**Sandeep:** [00:48:52] great. So we increase our teammates to attend 
conferences and read books and we. And Chris, our substitute to take a break, 
uh, every day and, uh, read books. If you know, when to take a break and utilize 
that time by reading something cool, something new that will be really, really 
helpful for us.
I bought her a couple of books last week. We're looking forward to finishing 
them by the end of this month. 
**Michaela:** [00:49:18] Yeah. What are the books that you're looking forward 
to? 
**Sandeep:** [00:49:21] One of them is a book called. So it's about how China is 
experimenting with AI and how they are utilizing machine learning and AI to 
drive their economy.
So that book was recommended by our investors at axle. So, uh, sorry. I bought 
that book last week and I'll read a couple of chapters and I'm looking forward 
to finishing that. 
**Michaela:** [00:49:42] Yeah. Cool. Do you have some ideas? I mean, for your 
community, how AI can bring that to the next step 
**Sandeep:** [00:49:48] we are already discussing about and how it began 
introduce some kind of intelligence to the field.
So if you come to Nashville right now, it's the, Peter's pretty simple. You 
follow, set up notes and people. Ambition that we create your fear, but are 
very, very good old person has node once trending or hashtag we have not come 
across them. And there are some posts that you might be missing that you might 
have that node or that person, but we can probably predict what kind of, who 
might like, and based on that, we can start suggesting them so we can start so 
distinguished books with people to follow.
That's one again, but it can be applied and another area where we can and do 
something cool. Is that suggesting yesterday? And if you're a blogger and you 
are writing, being able to specific things, and there's a good, good chance, we 
will be able to predict what are the things that you might want to write about 
in future?
So that's another kind of the area where we can do some cool experiments. 
**Michaela:** [00:50:45] That's really cool. Yeah. So I think we covered a lot 
in that interview. I'm really happy that you took the time to talk with me about 
hash node, your startup journey, your development practices, and the future. 
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank 
**Sandeep:** [00:50:58] you. Thanks. Thanks for having me. 
**Michaela:** [00:51:01] I'm also part of hash nodes. I think I joined in 
February and they really like it. So I'm looking forward to your adventure. 
Thank you. 
**Sandeep:** [00:51:08] Thanks a lot, Chad. I love it. All your blog posts and 
code reviews. I am looking forward to it. Thanks a lot. 
**Michaela:** [00:51:16] I hope you enjoyed another episode of the sup 
engineering unlock podcast.
Don't forget to subscribe. And I talked to you again in two weeks. 
**Sandeep:** [00:51:27] Bye.
