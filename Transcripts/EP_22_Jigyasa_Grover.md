# Transcript Episode 22: Jigyasa Grover
**Michaela:**[00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, Dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to 
Jigyasa Grover. But before we start, I just want to tell you that I'm taking a 
short summer break after this episode. This means that the next episode will be 
live by the end of August. There are many reasons for this break.
First, I really want to focus on writing the country book right now. Also, I 
want to reflect on a past episodes of the podcast. Spice things up a little bit. 
This coming fall, finally, life is too short to get caught up in a hamster 
wheel. So taking a break and enjoying life is super important. And after that 
I'm back full energy, bringing more wonderful episodes.
And also we, a bunch of new dates for my code review workshops. But let's get 
started with learning more about Jigyasa Grover, who is a machine learning 
engineer at Twitter. She's also involved in many communities that strive to 
close the gender gap and bring more people into open-source. In 2017, she won 
the red hat academic award for open-source contributions.
So I'm super thrilled to have their own way show. Thank you for being here. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:01:05] She gets her. Okay. Thank you, Michela. I'm so excited to be 
here with you today. 

**Michaela:**[00:01:10] Yeah, I'm also really excited. So you're my first machine 
learning engineer that have on my show. Normally I talk to software engineers or 
maybe product managers or CEOs.
So can you tell me a little bit, what does a machine learning engineer do and 
how does your day to day work life look like.

**Jigyasa:** [00:01:30] Sure. Uh, first of all, I'm honored to be your first ML 
engineer at your show. And if I talk about a high 
level explanation of like expectations from what an ML engineer does.
So in a corporate setting, the task of an ML engineer would be to bring the 
element of artificial intelligence to business logic. It would be their job to 
build margins, either from scratch or use off the shelf technologies using 
exciting. Like already existing frameworks with an added layer of their own 
variant and dual link.
They also had sculpt the format of the data that goes into the machine learning 
training or prediction services, and not only their build state of the art 
models, but they also had been productionize at skin, which is another key 
thing they have to do is still work at big companies or startups that cater to 
millions of people at once.
If I talk about how a day in my life looks like I would like to see it from my 
experience so far that each day is very, very different for every machine 
learning engineer. Some days it would be like endless exploration of data, 
trying to find patterns and curate some useful features, which I would also dumb 
as feature engineering.
Some days we would try as a team to build a model from scratch for a specific 
problem or tune our old. Existing models, you know, catch up to up-to date data. 
If they are working on an online mechanism. Some days it would be like 
setting up experiments, trying out different combinations of features using 
different desk services, performing grid, search and list.
Hyper-parameters experimenting with techniques to Fasten the training process, 
keeping up with the latest research by, you know, reading research papers, 
analyzing results from experiments, trying them to business prep, product 
metrics, and so on. So basically, yeah, unless, and a day in my life would look 
so much different every day.

**Michaela:**[00:03:28] Yeah, that sounds very exciting. So you are now a machine 
learning engineer at Twitter. How long have you been at Twitter? And did you 
start as a machine learning engineer? Like did you interview for that position 
or did you somehow grow into that position? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:03:42] No. I specifically interviewed for the machine learning 
engineer role, and it's been more than a year and a half since I've been working at Twitter. I work in the ads prediction team, and I'm 
fortunate enough that I was able to not only interview for the role and I also 
bad this. So yeah. 

**Michaela:**[00:04:02] Okay. That sounds really exciting. So, but have you been a 
machine learning engineer before you were interviewed for that? Have you worked 
at another company?
And did you do that already before? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:04:13] Yeah, so the thing is, before I came to know about machine 
learning, I've done like a lot of software engineering and open-source
contributions. I've also worked for, you know, institutions and for 
a brief period, I also worked at Facebook, which I don't very interesting 
intersection of software engineering, data science, and ads business.
It gives me a good insight into how companies leverage data and feed their 
systems. That's making billions of revenue. 

**Michaela:**[00:04:42] Yeah, it sounds really interesting. So when I was working 
at Microsoft, I worked, I had more or less a researcher role at the beginning. 
And so I wasn't a machine learning engineer, but we had to do a lot with data.
So we were analyzing data, collecting data, different kinds of data. Right. So I 
looked mostly at engineering data, right? So internal engineering data, for 
example, commit logs and, you know, communication information and things like 
that. And so one of the things that. I grew somehow into that position, right.
From, from a research background then to software engineering background. And then 
because I had to work with this data, obviously I worked or learned how to, you 
know, analyze this data. And it was also part of my PhD as well, but. I think 
then, then machine learning is another, you know, it's another facet of that 
whole thing.
Right? So I, I applied sometimes machine learning algorithm, but everything was 
out of the box. Right. I never created my own machine learning algorithm or 
something, but I, I worked a little bit with that. So how did you make this 
transition from, you know, the software engineering to. Machine Learning. Did 
you do a car's or was it really hands on at the company that you learned that 
how, how did that transition work?

**Jigyasa:** [00:06:01] Sure. So I kickstarted my journey by contributing to a lot 
of open-source projects while doing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. So 
why I took bachelors degree, like, why did I decided to do. Bachelor's in Computer Science was something that my parents asked me, like my dad himself is a 
computer professional and he works for the Government of India as senior 
technical director.
And then he asked me to, you know, pursue something in Computer Science because 
he saw that in a spark in me maybe. And then that's what I started, but I mostly 
was, you know, contributing to a lot of open-source projects and, you know, 
working with Federal JavaScript, you know, web technologies and android 
technologies, and so on.
And with that, I was also participating in a summer program, Google summer of code, 
which basically takes thousands of students all across the world. And, you know, 
makes them contribute to a lot of open-source projects. And one summer, that was 
my second time in the, in the summer program, I worked on a project called Suzy, 
which was aiming to build an open-source digital voice assistant, just take 
city, garden, et cetera.
But. Open-Source. So that's something about, you know, natural language 
processing and machine learning sparked and interest me. So I started taking up some 
ML courses in university and I wanted to do something for the, and that's 
when I applied for research internships and, you know, national research council 
of Canada, Institute of research and development, France, and got sponsorship 
from prestigious, international organization, which I'm very grateful for.
And that's where my. Interested in Machine Learning and Data Science 
intensified. I ended up, we know working with both stocks and professors, these 
research institutions, Dr. Professors, we've done a lot of research papers, 
buzz, and that's when I decided that I should pursue an advanced degree. And 
they graduated from university of California, San Diego with my master's degree.
You know, if it's specialization and focus, area of Machine Learning and 
Artificial Intelligence, and that's how my journey, you know, basically 
graduated from a normal computer science and the software engineering 
background, with a lot of open-source contribution still,  ultimately 
being a Machine Learning engineer and that's when I said I worked at Facebook 
for a brief period, uh, working on intersection of data science and Ad business.
And I also gained an interest in Ad business and then eventually moved . As a 
pure Machine Learning engineer, and it's been a wonderful experience so far. And 
then they obviously saw my grateful for telling me that I've had. 

**Michaela:**[00:08:32] Yeah, it sounds really amazing. I mean, heard also a lot of 
different countries, a lot of different cities.
Yeah. Uh, which, which reminds me of my time when I traveled a lot. But so you 
were traveling as well. You were traveling a lot. Were you traveling alone or 
did you bring your family or how was that period for you? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:08:51] So during that time, when I was contributing a lot to 
open-source projects and these sorts of internships, I was also helping help 
bridge the gender gap.
So I used to work with a lot of, yeah. If you know, women who code organizations 
from, in techniques and so on. And because of all things, I am so honored to 
have been Felicitated by red hat as a Women in open-source, academic award back in 
the year 2017. And that award, you know, the global or then recognition gave me 
actually wings.
And I started getting invitations from so many different. Conferences and some 
are, uh, schools and also on, like all throughout the world. And I would like get 
to travel. And during all these times, like even to the date, I've traveled to 
more than 15 countries all alone. And mostly I go for work. And even within the 
United States, I've traveled to like most of the States I've covered 50% of the 
States of the United States, just for Line of work, going to conferences, 
traveling.
Speaking of them holding workshops, et cetera. And to be honest, traveling has 
opened my eyes. And for many other ways, I get to experience different cultures. 
I get to meet people and I also get to see how it's all working temperament in 
different countries. And yeah. So yeah, I would say traveling definitely helps 
too, but yeah, these days, the times are such that everything's for, to

**Michaela:**[00:10:15] Yeah, I'm actually really, I'm really happy that I did 
My last travel in February before lock-down, just say, yeah, I came back and I was like, I'm 
really happy. I did that. We are all stuck. Right. I canceled all my travel 
plans. I should have gone to so many nice countries. Yeah. I'm really missing 
the travel, but I also, so you're, you're traveling and then for your 
internships, you actually stay a longer time in different areas.
Right. So, because internships normally are like three months or what is the 
time period that you did your internships? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:10:49] Yeah, same. So in Canada I did for three months and same 
goes for France in Paris. 
**Michaela:**[00:10:54] Okay. Okay. And then you also moved, right? So, because I, 
for example, I traveled a lot, but I also moved to different countries.
So I lived, which means, I would say living is more than six months. So did you 
really have to open a bank account? You know, find a proper, proper place to 
stay where you cannot live out of the hotel because it gets too expensive. So I 
lived in the UK, in Canada, in the US, in Germany, in Austria, in the 
Netherlands.

**Jigyasa:** [00:11:21] Oh, wow. 

**Michaela:**[00:11:21] Fuck you. I heard also that they were like, Uh, a few, a 
few countries, right. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:11:28] Mostly grew up in India and I've lived my parents. And then 
I, as I said, I moved to San Diego to pursue my master's degree and I've lived 
there for around, I would say two years. And then. Or maybe less like in year 
and a half.
Yeah. And then they eventually moved to San Francisco. So living alone it's of 
course, or a different experience altogether, but I also enjoy the freedom that 
I get and yeah. Embracing different cultures is what I like. 

**Michaela:**[00:11:57] Yeah. Yeah. I can imagine it. I mean, coming from India and 
then being in the United States must be quite eye opening.
I mean, yeah. I moved from, I moved the first big move that I made was from 
Austria to London and then to the Netherlands. But somehow, because it was all 
European countries, I thought, you know, It's all the same, which wasn't true. 
Right? Like, so I got a big shock when I realized that people, you know, it 
seems like we are, we're very similar in culture, right.
Culture and things like that. But then we are very different. Like the values, 
especially the values were something that were really difficult for me. Like 
when it comes to things like going to the doctors and what experiences or 
expectations you can have there. Right. Or how do you word, you know, what it 
would.
Treat as a serious illness and not so serious illness, those things. Right. I 
didn't expect that this will make a difference, but it did, but I can't imagine 
that coming from India and then going to, you know, the United states, even a 
bigger, a bigger difference. How was that for you? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:12:56] Trust me, I'm still scared of the United States healthcare 
system that I haven't stepped out of my apartment since four months, because I'm 
so scared of getting sick.
So yeah, the cultural side, of course, like really different, but I value both 
of them because you know, one is very close to my heart and the other is very 
close to how I work and all, but I'm trying to, you know, pick the best of both 
worlds and yeah, as you said, things might look same on, you know, from a eye.
Point of view, but when you go deep inside, but even in the case of Indian and
United, so they are completely different and yeah, but the thing is when I go 
back home, I enjoy that because I want this grown up there. So, 

**Michaela:**[00:13:36] yeah. Yeah. And so in, in India, where did you, where did 
you grew up? Was that like in a big city or on the countryside?

**Jigyasa:** [00:13:44] So in India, I grew up in a place called Chandigarh, which 
is the capital of the  capital city. And then it's looking through in the 
footage. So it's of any pretty down, I would say it's not super big, but yeah its growing. 
And then I went to like a proper Convent school, like the Christian guidance in 
school and it was like, so great.
Like on goes con in school, right. So life was so different. So yeah, so not 
something that they experienced, like the outside world was like completely 
different from what they experienced and that all has gotten in that Convent school. 

**Michaela:**[00:14:18] Yeah, I can imagine. So one of the things, I want to talk 
with you a little bit about is your experiences at Twitter, but also yeah.
At Facebook for software engineering practices and Machine Learning engineering, 
or I call it now data engineering, right. Or Data scientists. So when I was 
working at Microsoft, maybe I was in a very specific situation. Right. So I was. 
One of those research has slash software engineers, right? In, in, in this large 
software engineering team.
And so all the data engineering and, you know, like research obligations were on 
my shoulders, but there weren't a lot of others. Right. So we were always the 
driving forces right. For those things. And then we informed like the, the other 
people that were doing the implementations or, you know, like we were, for 
example, making the prototypes and they were doing the real implementation down 
and things like that.
Right. But what I realized that is comparing with. Software engineering 
practices, the practices that we had as Data engineers, they were less 
sophisticated. There was less rigor right there. There were still a lot of 
question on how do we test our data efficiently, right? How do we review our 
code or not only the code because the code is pro pro not that important, right?
It's the data and how do we wish in our data? And somehow those questions seem 
quite. Unanswered a little bit in, in the start data science world versus what 
we have in engineering, software engineering world. Right. You know, it's like a 
push of a button and you know, like you have your, your DevOps chains that are 
automatically doing everything for you.
How is that for you? Do you have like this. Software engineering rigor as well 
in this data engineering world. And do you feel also, like, I felt sometimes 
like, so lonely ranger more or less, right. Because I was surrounded by a lot of 
software engineers, but then the data science task, right. Only on my shoulder, 
maybe there was one or two other people that we occasionally talked about what's 
happening.
But I guess at Twitter, in your team, it seems like you're a bigger team where 
there are a lot of people that you can exchange your ideas and things like that.

**Jigyasa:** [00:16:29] Yeah, Michaela. So in that I would 
totally, yeah. that I would like to echo like software engineering practices are more like, 
sort of a rigid, like if you know, you follow the Italian method or the 
waterfall software development mentality, or this have like six set of rules, 
like after this, you will do testing.
And if it doesn't work, you go back to the steps. So that the rule book is like, 
One, two, three and four, like bullet points, like straight up to the fleet, but 
in Machine Learning engineering or data science, as you said, things are not 
at all rigid because they, they are mostly trying to solve open ended questions.
There's no like strict solution to a question, right. You always have to do a 
lot of, it's more of like a, like to think of. It has science, you know, like a 
chemistry experiment. So you have to do a lot of experiments, fill the thing 
works. So that's why you cannot put like time, you cannot time box any 
experiment, because you never know the matrix training would take two extra 
hours than what you thought of.
I don't want to take two extra days. And then sometimes after running the entire 
module, you would relate. It doesn't work as I expected. So you have to like 
read on all over again, whereas in software engineering, I think that the idea 
of open-ended-ness or the idea of ambiguity this less as compared to the case on 
Machine Learning engineering, hence it's easier to time box those things.
It can easily be said, Oh, after one week from now, I want, you know, this UI to 
be present. So it's much more feasible than what you set expectations. So I 
installed some Machine Learning engineering hands are even opening. My Purdue 
does not follow these strict because I guess everyone in there is from a machine 
learning background.
Like what sort of people? Yeah. PhDs or masters degree. So the very well known 
would be how experimentation goes. So we are mostly allowed to, you know, Free 
format and deliver as, and when we think the model is performing as per our 
expectations. 

**Michaela:**[00:18:23] Yeah, that does really good. I mean, my experience was when 
I started and we had like this team, then we had a very, very great leader, like 
a wonderful manager.
That was also a reason why I actually joined the team at Microsoft. And he. 
Absolutely understood the exploratory nature of our work, right research side 
that we had. And that, you know, as you said, you cannot, time box it like you 
cannot say, Oh, we are going to solve that problem in six weeks, we are done.
Right. Because sometimes you don't, you don't even know if you are able to solve 
the problem. You know, in a good way, in a good enough way, like really makes 
sense. Right? Otherwise it wouldn't be research. And then at the very end of my, 
my time at Microsoft, we had like a reorg and I got a completely different 
manager and he tried to, um, put us into scrum.
You know, time-frames 

**Jigyasa:** [00:19:16] and things like 

**Michaela:**[00:19:16] that, that always had like tradition do you know? And, and 
he always had, but there must be a positive answer at the end. Right. And it 
must work. And then I said, well, if I, if I can only try out what will work in 
the end, right. Then this is not research. Right. It's not an, a bold enough 
question if you know that it will work from, from the get go.
Right. Or if you know how long it will take. Yeah. So there was a big clash 
between different, you know, ways of working. So, yeah. Interesting. So you are 
a group of Machine Learning engineers that really understand that the nature of 
the thing that you're doing, what's it the same as at Facebook? Or was that a 
different experience there?

**Jigyasa:** [00:20:00] So at Facebook, as I said, my role was not pure machine 
learning. It was like a mix of software engineering, data science and ads 
besides work and so on. So yeah, the working side was completely different 
there. They followed like strict set, Oh, by this, this should be done. And, you 
know, doing like a strict bag.
And of course that company is more advanced a like. More mature in terms of 
engineering. So, yeah, I think so it's a different, but I enjoy working at like 
put the site at the client. So, but it depends on the role, I guess. Yeah. 

**Michaela:**[00:20:31] Yeah. And so how do you, how do you review, for example, 
your, your code, you review it, do you work together with other people that are 
looking at what you're producing or maybe at the data that you're working on and 
how do you test your systems? Or do you have like a methodology in place there for doing it? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:20:50] Yeah, sure. So for testing, of course we have like. 
Different, you know, services that we use and different yeah. Different expectations that 
we want, the, you know, the product or whatever model that we build to satisfy. 
And as I said, we have a team of like all Machine Learning engineers and people 
come from like very advanced backgrounds.
Many of them are very experienced. So they obviously helped me as I'm growing in 
my role. So review process, they help. And then for, as I said, for 
expectations, we have them set on ready, and then we rigorously keep testing the 
model on different sets of data and see how it's performing. And this is, you 
know, asper our expectations and so on.

**Michaela:**[00:21:31] And so now you're in San Francisco and while there's COVID
happening right now, the pandemic, do you, do you go to the office or are you 
all working from home now? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:21:42] No, it's been more than four months. So they've been working 
at home and twitter has been completely supportive. They have provided, you know, 
all the budgets for setting up a work from home from home office, at home office 
and so on.
And then they haven't asked us to come back to the office and I don't think 
that's. It's going to happen anytime soon, but the good part is Jack, our CEO. 
He also announced like flexible working style. That is your free time to be 
remote forever if you want to do so. That's something that I'm really excited 
looking for.
Yeah. 

**Michaela:**[00:22:17] Yeah, I can imagine this is opening up a lot of 
opportunities, I think. And so do, do you see any drawbacks? Do you experience 
drawbacks working with your colleagues, some collaboration issues that you're 
having because of the remote set up? 
**Jigyasa:** [00:22:33] I would like to say so far. It's good, but of course I miss, 
you know, a little bit of the personal interactions we used to have, you know, 
it's like going for a coffee break and then you meet someone and then you just.
Chatting and the elevator, they meet someone or in the lunch line or something. 
Of course I miss those little portion interactions, but yeah, work-wise it 
hasn't been like a drastic change because we've been able to collaborate 
successfully where Jean so far. 

**Michaela:**[00:23:00] Yeah. So everybody is remote right now or some people yeah.
Back in the office. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:23:05] No, everyone's remote. Yeah, 

**Michaela:**[00:23:07] I think that that helps. Right. So if, if, if you would, 
it'd be few onsite and a few would be remote and it's probably harder, but now 
everybody is on the same and the same, you know, has the same challenges. And so 
everybody has to work towards yeah. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:23:23] Yeah, the conversations actually happened on the team 
channel.
Now it's not like, Oh, someone, some of them are no talking in person and the 
people who are remote, they feel like, Oh, fear of missing out. Did I miss on 
some conversations? Like interesting ones. So yeah, everyone and everyone's 
remote. That definitely helps. 

**Michaela:**[00:23:42] So I imagine, I mean, I feel like this, when I'm talking to 
you, you, you did so many things and it seems like you're super ambitious and 
you were very, very successful with your way.
So can you tell us a little bit about how did you get into open-source software 
and you know, how, what would you say like for somebody at the beginning or, you 
know, that wants to advance their career? What are some really good steps that 
you thought well, These are some of those steps that really brought me forward 
because they are maybe a few steps that looking back, you think, well, this was 
really like leveraging or boosting my career.
You already sound like this open-source Academic award really opened a lot of 
doors. Is there something else like that you said, well, If I wouldn't all do it 
all over, this is exactly where I would focus my energy. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:24:33] So I would like to share, I actually got started into 
open-source. It's actually a very interesting story.
So I know it's pursuing my bachelor's degree, you know, as I'm not really 
quality would do, like back in those days would visit the library just to use 
like, you know, the high speed internet and us calling on the phone mindlessly 
through all your sources. So I was seeing exactly the same and that's where I 
came across.
Uh, Tech conference that was happening, you know, on social media. And they 
mentioned something about Pharo. And then I heard the word file, like. Then I 
heard back in the day, like I only talked about, you know, more than off the 
ancient Egypt and I could not relate it to tech. So, you know, that day I just 
went back home and I did a quick Google search and that's another layer like 
right.
PHARO. It's an actually immersive programming experience and a 
powerful environment focused. Basically it's taking an idea and oil into one 
based on an object-oriented programming language known as my doc. So I thought, 
Hmm, really interesting that like a very interesting name. And then that, then I 
started reading more about it.
They had like internet, really a chat, like a chat link to join. I thought, you 
know, why not give it a try? Like. But I joined the chat, but I didn't know what 
to post. I saw lots of developers. And back in those days, IRC was still really 
open-source developers used to talk to each other. So, you know, gathering on 
my courage.
I adopt a few people in my university who were actually contribution to open-source and said, 
Oh, you know, they said, you can just go and say hi and they're 
led their messages and under blogs. So I gathered all my courage to introduce myself, that 
IRC link and explicit. Hey, my name is Tim Gasa. I instantly came to know about 
the word failure and this programming environment.
I would love to know more about it. That's it like? That was my message. And it 
was my luck or something. There was a mentor from China and in Martin who was 
online. And then he sent me like a couple of links to the documentations said, 
Oh, you should read through these. I was like, okay, yeah, I tried the example, 
send it to 30.
And so, because the tutorial had, you know, link still basically, except to 
install it, you know, make some very small gains, stick that door and not on 
that stuff. So I said, okay, sure. Why not? Summer break came. I was like 
enjoying at home. So I was taught, I started, I opened the link and that biz 
fiber 3.0 was in the works and federal four point or was.
Getting like, you know, Traction. And they were like helping in productionizing 
it. So I tried it basically. I had found a 4.0, and then they thought, Oh, 
that's not work. And I changed that example, let change some code and it's such 
a to work. So I went back to Martin and said, Hey, I was trying this example.
And then I see this works in Pharo three, but not Pharo four. And for Pharo 
four, I had to do this change to make it working. And he said, Oh, good. Find in 
the documentation. Why don't you go? And. Open up a pull request for the Pharo. 
And then he talked to me about, or I should open an issue first and then submit 
a pull request as like, okay.
And unknowingly the small bug fix, turned out to be my first open-source 
contribution. And that's when I got the hang of it. You know, I used to, not 
only trying examples, I ended up making my own games sake, you know, contact 
manager and so on and small dog. And then I got the opportunity to work on 
Google Summer of Code.
Five, both times I've worked with the organization on this fire station. And 
then I said, the second day is then my spark and Machine Learning and all 
interest in intensified. Right. So that's how, like I connect my journey from, you 
know, being a normal student at the college, you know, trying to get through all 
the Computer Science classes in the end, turning out to be not interested in 
Machine Learning and Data Science. So that's how my interest in open-source started and it was, I 
owe it all to my curiosity, I would say. And the fun fact is to Gasa in  Swedish 
actually means curiosity. So, yeah. So I guess I would always want 
to say like, however difficult things missing, but if you try, you know, these 
days you have so many, like just a quick Google footsteps, so at least try to, 
you know, make sense of what you see and yeah.
Curiosity helps. Yeah. 

**Michaela:**[00:28:54] And, and what you were saying is what I hear very often. 
People advise that if you want to get started in open-source, the easiest foot 
into the door would be to start with the documentation, right. Make changes and 
improvements to the documentation because it's. It's a little bit easier, but 
you also get to know the software and to get to know the people, because you 
also said, well, there was this mentor, right?
So you have to get somebody that gives you lend to your hand right. On your, on 
your way into, into open-source as well. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:29:25] Yeah. So on that note, I would also want to say in my spirit 
to give back to the community, I want to be a mentor now. Like I've mentored 
people in like so many global community programs like, Outreachy, Rails Summer of 
Code, Google Coding,Google Summer of Code, uh, Google, and even lately, 
locally in on these communities, because I feel like there were so many mentors 
that helped me during my journey.
And it's my turn to give back and regarding the views getting into open-source . So people 
usually think like, Coding is the only way to get into open source. Whereas I 
think that open-source factuality, it's a way of collaboration and project ideas 
and thinking. So I also do like different talks and workshops at conferences 
where I talk about different ways to dive into open-source, like diving deep 
into, okay.
It's not all about coding. So there are so many other ways you can, you know, 
get info fed open source and documentation is the one and the fault foremost. 

**Michaela:**[00:30:22] Yeah. I think that, especially for me, for example, there 
is this probably social aspect. That's also holding me back from contributing a 
little bit because, you know, you're, I would get intimidated quite quickly.
Right. And then I feel like you, you need to. You need a little bit help to 
understand where you start or your, you know, very quickly people could say, Oh, 
this is a dumb question. Or you should have known, or, you know, be, be maybe a 
little bit rude to you. So I, I think that knowing how to approach different 
communities and having, you know, a mentor that helps you can be very.
Can be very helpful. Did you make any negative experiences in the open-source 
community? I 

**Jigyasa:** [00:31:05] would like to say, like so far, my experience has been 
mostly positive. Of course there have been like, like teeny tiny instances where 
I felt, Oh, this is not the right way. For example, when I was a student and 
applying for a Google Summer of Code.
I would actually receive messages like from people, like see from like a couple 
of them asking me to not apply for a different project since they were also 
interested in applying for the same project and it would create a class because 
then the mentor would have to choose like, which one of them like he should 
select.
So, but I was very adamant because of like I was contributing to this. So maybe the 
mentors should just see like, who contributes the most or maybe who has the 
talent and it should be mostly. Based on just the cost to eliminate competition 
does not mean there won't be any competition, any go forward to date. So you 
should have the confidence in yourself.
And I think it comes with it does not come overnight. I totally agree with the 
social aspect of, you know, being hesitant, I've been in their shoes. Like if 
you and I used to contribute, like no one, no one other than maybe my father 
knew that I was contributing because I was so scared to, you know, share with 
people and like, Oh, that I'm contributing to open-source.
So even my. No GitHub handle was my foot and like my initials initially. And 
then I changed it after new year because Adelaide though, the initials won't 
work, mate, it was just like JG or something, because, and then didn't even have 
a profile picture because I was very hesitant because I didn't want, you know, 
people.
You know, as I said, judging, and I, you didn't even want people in my new class 
to know that I was doing something like that, but later on it changed. So it 
just took me a couple of months to get used to. And after that it was fine. I 
had my leg full name up there. I had my profile picture, but too, but it just took 
me like a couple of months, I would say.

**Michaela:**[00:32:48] Yeah, it's probably, I get into Twitch right now because I 
started streaming and it's also veered, right? Like you're streaming and you get 
to know what you actually have to do, or, you know, if you even like it or not, 
so I'm not. Yeah. And now I'm not announcing it a lot because I don't want, and you 
know, a lot of people to actually watch.
So I'm actually happy if there are only a few people on my stream because I want 
to get, you know, used to and grow into that new experience, I think. And I 
think when I. When I'm a little bit more confident, I will probably announce it 
a little bit more. Maybe I'm not even continuing who knows. Right. But I think 
maybe I can relate to that for open-source as well.
Right? So you make your tiny contributions and they are like a little bit hiding 
behind a certain room or you notice you need initials. And then if you're 
feeling confident, you're actually can, can, can have that much more. So you were 
also talking about the bridging the gender gap. And so I know that you have been.
Active in the Woman Tech Maker community, and also a Woman Who Code community. 
How did you get into that? And are you still doing that? And now you told me 
that you're mentoring. Was that the same thing or was where the different 
activities? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:34:06] So I started off by, volunteering at local Women 
Who Code and Google Women Tech-Makers communities back home.
And. It initially started with, you know, sharing how I did my first open-source 
contributions or, you know, helping people set up their GitHub profiles and, you know, 
fork projects and so on. And then later on I started, you know, holding workshops 
that I would talk about, you know, Oh, let's spend a game python, and so on.
So I did that, you know, that, and then virtually, also in programs like, you 
know, Learn IT Girl, Google Summer of Code or , I would just be a mentor. You know, if they had any 
questions or just questions and like not even technical, but how to approach 
them, you know, open-source contributor our open source developer and so on. And 
I did that back home.
And even here in San Francisco, I'm doing it. The physical aspect might have 
reduced because I have a full time job now, but I try to keep it virtually. For 
example, I would join like a workshop at a conference or the school to like, 
Weekly coffee chats. They have around here, the STI and so on. So that's how 
I've tried to, you know, give back to the community because I've been helped a 
lot by mentors.
I taught, like I should also have the other reason, 

**Michaela:**[00:35:25] you know, what also would help. I think if you would be 
open to share your. Interviewing experience, especially for me Machine Learning. 
How can I imagine that? How did you, you know, you applied for that, how does an 
interview look like for a Machine Learning engineer?
What were your questions and how did you prepare? And yeah, 

**Jigyasa:** [00:35:48] so yeah, for Machine Learning interview, I would say this is 
a little more trickier than Software Engineering jobs because, you know, 
software engineering Job Interviewers would mostly focus on data structures and 
algorithms, but as machine learning you required, especially if you work in a 
big company, as I said, you not only build models on paper, you also have to 
help them productionize at scale.
And for that, it requires engineering skills. So they test you on engineering 
skills. First, they would ask you to now implement data structures and algorithms. 
And although uses shenanigans. And then later on, they would move on to, 
you know, specific machine learning questions. They would ask you what. No 
different kinds of models are they would give you a use case.
And that, for that use case, you would have to think from top to bottom, like 
what kind of features now you have to go creative what kind of features you 
would want in the module? What kind of model would work the best supervised 
unsupervised SVM, PC analysis. All those feature importance, feature, 
correlation, all these what kind of metrics.
So what kind of lost functions would you base judge your model on what this 
objective function you would optimize on, and all of these things? So you have to be 
like very thorough about the fundamentals. They will ask you the ins and outs of it. 
That's what my experience has been. I would suggest if you would have like, you 
know, fundamentals of Machine Learning brushed up, it would be like a very smooth 
interview, but.
Make sure that you also have your engineering skills brushed up, like you would 
have going to your data structures and algorithms them as well. 

**Michaela:**[00:37:25] And so did you have, like, did you have to code, did you 
whiteboard or how, how was that at Twitter? How long was the process also like 
Microsoft? I think it was a whole day, probably eight to nine hours of 

**Jigyasa:** [00:37:38] that song.
That song. Yeah. 

**Michaela:**[00:37:39] Yeah. And it was really long. Yeah. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:37:41] Yeah. I remember having three interviews or one hour each. 
And with like 20 minutes break between each or something. So it was around four to 
five hours . Yeah. And between that, they also had a round with them in late. My to be 
manager or to be that lead where they would just ask like, you know, usual life 
questions or behavior questions, they would ask me like, you know what I expect 
from the job, just to know, like, if I'm the correct fit or not.

**Michaela:**[00:38:14] Okay. And so was it all on one day or did you have like a 
screening interview first and then you had this onsite? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:38:22] Oh, for me, it was all in one day I was actually approached 
by the manager of my current team. Find an email asking me to interview. So. 

**Michaela:**[00:38:32] Okay. So you went straight to the onsite interview? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:38:36] Yes.
Yeah. Fortunately, yeah. Okay. 

**Michaela:**[00:38:39] Yeah. That's that's really good. And so now that you're a 
Machine Learning engineer, what does the, is there some career path for many 
Machine Learning engineers? Would you become a Machine Learning engineering 
Manager, for example? Is that something that exists at Twitter or, 

**Jigyasa:** [00:38:55] yeah, definitely.

**Michaela:**[00:38:57]How does that work? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:39:09]So we have like, As a machine learning answer, of course we 
can grow on to be like a Staff Machine running ads in our Principal Machine 
running internet and so on. But if you also want to get a little more inclined 
towards other managerial positions, you can, after you reach a certain level, 
you can also be like a Machine Learning engineer Manager and Machine Learning 
and so on.
And so work on Machine Learning to Machine Learning engineering 
Manager would do, would be to manage a team of Machine Learning engineers. So 
that is something like, if that's the part you're looking for, like managing the 
team, you could do that. Or if you want to be like pure Engineer, you can pass that path, but, 

**Michaela:**[00:39:40] okay.
So what, what, what do you think that you will do? Do you know already 

**Jigyasa:** [00:39:44] so far? I'm I don't plan like my life, like 10 years in 
advance or something like that. I try to take it, you know, step a day, but for 
now, if I see myself, I would. You know, continue the tech part as long as I can. 

**Michaela:**[00:40:01] Yeah. That's, that's also what I really liked that 
Microsoft that you didn't have, you have to choose, like there was not like 
you're an engineer and then you're a manager as the next, you know, as a next 
step.
But you had like this parallel, really technical track and it wasn't called 
staff engineers, but it's like Principal. And then you would be like one of 
those Technical leaders. Right. So you could even become like, if you, if you're 
very ambitious, right, you would be this distinguished engineer, for example, 

**Jigyasa:** [00:40:25] you don't have to take over it.

**Michaela:**[00:40:27] The the, the management part, which I liked. Right. Because 
very often in smaller companies, especially there is like, if you want to 
advance your career, you have to switch from the technical side to the managing 
side, right? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:40:40] Yeah. Yes. 

**Michaela:**[00:40:43] Okay, so very cool. Thank you so much for being on my show 
today for sharing everything that you did, you learnt on your way with us.
I think it was very, very insightful for me and I hope also for my listeners, is 
there something else that you would like to share with us and that we haven't 
talked about? 

**Jigyasa:** [00:41:01] No, I guess I've touched most of the aspects. Thank you so 
much Michaela And it was so wonderful talking to you today. 

**Michaela:**[00:41:07] Wonderful.
Yeah. So I will link to your profile to your GitHub profile to your Twitter in 
the show notes. If you want to see for yourself, what you guess is all about, 
just look at my show notes. And so just have to say thank you 

**Jigyasa:** [00:41:21] so much. 

**Michaela:**[00:41:22] Have a good day. Okay. Bye bye. 

**Jigyasa:** [00:41:25] Bye. Bye. 

**Michaela:**[00:41:27] I hope you enjoyed another episode of the Software Engineering Unlocked podcast.
Don't forget to subscribe and I will talk to you after the summer break in a few 
weeks. Bye.
