# Transcript Episode 31 with Tomasz Lakomi


**Michaela:**   [00:00:00] Going to start the recording. So yeah. Can you say 
something? 

**Tomasz:** [00:00:03] Hello? Hello? 


**Michaela:**   [00:00:05] Okay. Yeah, that was fine. Yeah. That's that's good. 
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So let me start. I know we started with 10 seconds of 
silence. I'll have to restart the recording here as well. Record on the cloud. 
Okay. Recorded, recorded. Okay. 10 seconds of silence for the, for the audio 
improvement thing.
Very good. Okay. So yeah. Oh, I normally redo the first start. Right. But just 
to give us a little bit like official podcasting spirit, right. You know, and 
what come to the soft engineering unlocked podcast. I'm your host, dr. McKayla 
and today after pleasure to talk to Thomas Lakshmi, is that correct? Tomasz 

**Tomasz:** [00:00:57] Thomas.
Oh, that was excellent. 

**Michaela:**   [00:00:59] And how's the last name? 

**Tomasz:** [00:01:02] My last name is Wakanda, but I am not expecting you to 
pronounce it correctly. Not call me. Welcome, so, 

**Michaela:**   [00:01:09] okay, 

**Tomasz:** [00:01:12] cool. 

**Michaela:**   [00:01:14] Okay. Hello and welcome to the soft engineering 
unlocked podcast. I'm your host, dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to 
talk to Thomas Acoma.
Thomas is a senior front end engineer at the O X group, which is a fast green 
platform for trading businesses. Tomas is also an ag head instructor. He 
certified for AWS and he's a speaker and bloggers. So I'm really happy to have 
Thomas here with me. Thomas might come to my show, 

**Tomasz:** [00:01:43] happy to be here. 

**Michaela:**   [00:01:45] So Thomas, maybe as a start, can you tell me a little 
bit about your role at O L X group?
I did read that website. It says it's a platform, but buying and selling cars, 
finding housing, getting jobs, buying, and selling household goods. But what are 
your team's responsibilities? What are your tasks at this company? 

**Tomasz:** [00:02:04] Sure. So, as you've mentioned, like basically what we do 
at this group is about, we did a huge number of different websites for like 
buying stuff, selling stuff.
So as you mentioned, we have cars, we have real estate, we have goods, we have 
services. So there's obviously lot of things going on. And obviously, you know, 
my team in particular, like we cannot be responsible for everything. The way we 
work at all X group is about each team is focused on a certain area of the 
business and they own it completely.
So my team is focused on all X jobs because not only you can bank stuff, but you 
can also find a better hopefully job at all X. So what we are building is what 
we are building solutions. That has people find a, you know, a newer better job 
in particular, we are working on something that is called a candidate profile, 
because the idea that we have in mind is about, you know, CVS are kind of 
outdated because this concept of a CV has been around for ages and we need, we 
need something better.
So not only people can create, basically there are four or five at all X, but we 
also are going to use the data in the profile. In order to find people. I bet 
her job automatically because we send them recommendations based on their 
profile and also the base on the job ads that were actually, they were going 
through on, on the other side.
So we are kind of, kind of trying to find a better job for them. 

**Michaela:**   [00:03:32] Okay. So can I imagine it as like LinkedIn, but a 
little bit different or is it very different? 

**Tomasz:** [00:03:39] It is somewhat different than LinkedIn. I think LinkedIn 
has this very LinkedIn is very focused on like white collar jobs. So, you know, 
white collar, basically what I mean by that is that, you know, your work in the 
office, you probably have a product to probably have a, you know, a title that 
is in English and you probably spend your time in front of a computer.
Uh, this is not the reality of like, I suppose like majority of people, because 
people have different careers, people have different skill sets and whatnot. So 
what we are trying to build is to have a product that is somewhat similar to 
LinkedIn as a new, create a profile, and you can use it to find a better job, 
but with a much broader focus.
So we are want to target basically everyone who is looking for a job in Poland. 
And also help them find a better job because like not everybody is used to, you 
know, searching for a job, offer online about the student negotiating. So one of 
the experiments that we've had a couple of bumps ago, there's also building a 
platform in which the employer would have to provide a salary because we also 
would like to in like a scenario, avoid this process of, you know, Would that 
be?
I have to work it and negotiate a salary. How much do you want? How much are you 
willing to give me? How much do you want? And so back and so 

**Michaela:**   [00:04:58] forth. Yeah, for me, it's always mind blowing that, 
you know, I, to be honest, I haven't known about ALEKS before. Right. And so for 
this podcast, research it a little bit and I went on the website and I see like 
this large numbers of employees that you have.
And then I went to the career side and I see, wow. There, I think if I, on the 
top of my head, I think there were like 16 open positions in data analysis or 
data engineering, something like this. Right. Then there were like 80 positions 
for engineers. Right. And I was like, Wow, because I worked as a data scientist 
or like a researcher before.
Right. And sometimes struggling, like where are the companies that are actually 
hiring, you know, people with these skill sets and, and then you're stumbling 
across a company that you never heard of anything like, well, this is not a 
small company. It's a large corporation, right. That you're actually working 
for.
And so, yeah, maybe what would be interesting for me is like, well, you said my 
team, right? So my team, and then you're working with data scientists. What are 
other engineers that you're working with, right. Your front-end engineers or who 
is on your team, you know, do you have like testers on your team? Do you have 
like designers on your team and, and then you're working with data scientists.
How does the communication work like this? Can you tell me a little bit about 
the structure and you know, how, how are teams collaborating at all X. 

**Tomasz:** [00:06:11] Sure. So the way we kind of work at all X, all X group is 
about each team is a park. So we are defined the divided into something that is 
called a park. And I park is this like self-contained unit of the organization 
that can ship their stuff to the production.
So each park has, you know, If you need 10 engineers, you have a front end 
engineer, you have buckets, engineers you'll have product managers. There's 
usually an engineering manager. If there are no engineers on the team, that's 
kind of all, it's also useful. Some teams have a dedicated designer, some teams 
are working closely with, with, you know, with the designers, but they're not 
necessarily in that team because some, some teams have like different needs when 
it comes to insect design.
We also have a business analyst in our team. So again, like this is a very kind 
of self contained unit. What I like about this setup is because I used to work 
in the companies where we have, we had a front department and we have a backend 
department and not only was communication tricky, but also working in an actual 
agile way was somewhat difficult because as a front end engineer, if I wanted to 
get, by the way, I would like to get this one more piece of data from the 
backend.
Then you had to go do the backend team, talk to them, but they apparently have 
the authority for this, for this grant. So I have to wait for the next bit and 
whatnot. Whereas in our current setup, we've worked very closely together. So we 
are not working in a silo, but quite the contrary, we are working very closely 
together with backend engineers, front end engineers, all of those skill sets 
that are required to build amazing products.
Everything is included in that team. And I are very proud as a front-end 
engineer of our backend engineers, because there are actually submitting a 
feedback when it comes to design, when it comes to UX solutions that we did it. 
So this is honestly, this is something that I haven't seen before, like this 
level of commitment to building a great product and not only, you know, jogging 
Jason data, as some of buckets, engineers are used to do.
Okay. 

**Michaela:**   [00:08:21] Yeah. And so how many front end engineers are, for 
example, in your team, 

**Tomasz:** [00:08:27] those teams, they don't have to be very large. So in my 
thing currently, we have two trumpet engineers. There's two buckets engineers. 
We have a dedicated contact in the data science team. So he's not technically in 
our team, but we are working very closely together.
We also have a dedicated designer, a product manager, business analyst, and my 
engineering manager. So there's less than 10 people in total. I liked this role 
about each team should be large enough that a one pizza can fit the entire 
thing. And I think this is a good metric for how large the teams should be.

**Michaela:**   [00:09:03] Yeah. I like that. Well with 10 people and one pizza, 
I mean, everybody gets a little slice. Really? 

**Tomasz:** [00:09:12] Yeah. 

**Michaela:**   [00:09:13] Yeah. And so one of the things that I love is code 
reviews. And so if you have like two front end engineers, do you do code reviews 
for each other? Or do you have like the back end engineers also looking at your 
code?
And are you looking at the code off the backend engineers and visa versa or is 
that like very dedicated? Like, 

**Tomasz:** [00:09:34] so there there's a couple of things here. First stop. We 
each one of us. Tries to grow. So I am trying my best to kind of review 
infrastructure changes. We are use in several of the framework, something bucket 
the engineers are eager to take a look into what's happening on front and side, 
but.
The the way it's usually happens is, but my team is only a smart, small part of 
a way larger organization. So we have lots of front-end engineers, backend 
engineers and whatnot. And so, because those teams are self-contained, you may 
have this impression that we are working, you know, completely alone in a silo.
We don't look at what we are doing. Give us alone. This is not the case. So 
front-end engineers from other teams. There are even with my staff, I am doing 
my best to review their code and whatnot. So I think this is quite useful 
because first of all, we do require two approvals on each merge request. So by 
definition, there are two of us.
I cannot approve my own stuffs. I have to get somebody else from another team to 
also approve my changes, but it also builds this culture of at least having this 
vague idea of what the other teams are doing. And if should they be Aeneid, they 
can also contribute to the other codebases and visa versa.

**Michaela:**   [00:10:50] Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And so now I imagine 
you write you like this one pack, and now this is a large corporation or large 
organization. So I'm thinking, well, there's your pack. And then you're 
probably. Maybe 20 other backs or even more. Right. So how do you, how do you 
select the, the packs that would review your code and would it be obviously the 
same, you know, like have you, do you have like two other bags that you are 
like, you know, working together or do you randomly allocate people from 
different packs to look at your cards?

**Tomasz:** [00:11:19] I would say it depends on the, on the scope of the 
changes, because. I am working in a pocket that is, like I said, we are building 
products for four jobs. So we are helping people find a better job. There are 
also other parks that are also in this kind of like job ecosystem. So there are 
other solutions for instance, for recruiters.
So if something, if it might change, is. Or obviously in this domain of looking 
for jobs. So this is like in this part of the code base, or there's this context 
of, you know, the stuff that we are actually currently building if necessary. I 
am probably going to ask for code review some of the members of that team, but 
if I'm doing something that is more like platform related, so I'm making kind of 
like core changes.
I don't know, I'm updating a very major dependency in our code base. I am 
probably going to reach out to somebody from our platform team, because a lot of 
things that I especially hate as a front end engineer is Bheki for direction. 
And my goal is as a developer and as passionate about testing in general is I 
don't want the big production.

**Michaela:**   [00:12:27] So I actually read through one of the, your article 
is that you also have mentioned on LinkedIn is one of the articles that you're 
most proud of. That's most popular, something like this, it's called a seven 
years as a software developer, right? The lessons that you have learned there, 
and you were talking about cultural base again.
Right? And so one of the things that you were saying, and I'm just, I'm now. 
Quoting you robot him more or less, right? USA I've personally seen people 
submitting code reviews when X, right. The person wasn't in the office, or why 
was it a business trip? X was a brilliant programmer, but enduring through his 
code reviews process was a chore.
If you leave 15, eight pigs. Unkind comments under IPR of someone who is a 
junior programmer. You're not proving your super warranty as a developer. You 
are proving that you're not a good human being. Right. And so. How do you handle 
that? Like how, how do you, how do you handle unkind commons and how do you 
surface that at a co as a company, as a team?
You know, how do you deal with that? 

**Tomasz:** [00:13:31] So at the beginning I would like to add, but if I were to 
write this part again, I would probably add some more new ones with that. That 
was a little bit of a, of a hot steak. And, you know, there were lots of 
comments on Reddit or regarding that part, because it seems to kind of coast, a 
little bit of attention.
Which I, I, I don't think it's necessarily to the boat because the main point is 
still there. You should be kind to other people when it comes to kind of like 
dealing with that. I, I think it's not easy. Uh, you are, you're probably the 
best person in the world to things like having by the cultural views.
But nevertheless, my personal idea is that. You should always try to reach out 
to somebody when they're, for instance, I could even can count comments in total 
because there are two things that maybe happen. First of all, they maybe are not 
aware that their comments are on time. Maybe they are just trying to be direct.
Maybe they didn't have the time to kind of, I don't know, use the word please in 
a sentence, which I think it should happen anyways. But it could also be that 
something is actually happening in their personal lives and they're on not, are 
they feeling like doing code for this today? So that's one thing that could 
happen.
Uh, nevertheless, I would always reach out to that difference and say, by the 
way, those are kind of like cultural group guidelines. We are reviewing the 
code. We are not reviewing the person. So, you know, please try to be kind and. 
Me like bad code, because you know, when you leave like 50 comments on the 
cultural cultural view and you are very nitpicky, you publishing the discount is 
terrible.
I like to think that everybody tries to do the job as fast as they possibly can. 
Nobody is a developer. Nobody is going to go to work in the morning and says, 
I'm going to ride some terrible coach today. Nobody does that. So when you are 
seeing something in coating that you are shocked, that you think is terrible 
consider that you are maybe not aware of their constraints, maybe there some 
context that you are not aware of, maybe there's something that's sort of, that 
should be improved.
Maybe you should talk to them. Maybe if you see a country that doesn't have any 
tests whatsoever, maybe propose to fire off and those tests together. 

**Michaela:**   [00:15:57] Yeah, I like, and you also had that actually in your. 
In your blog post, right. You were saying, well, go and change the channel, the 
communication channel.
Right. So instead of leaving all those comments in the culture of you, why not 
reaching out to the person directly and asking, you know, if you can be, as you 
said, of help in a different way. Right. And I think that's really important. 
So, and maybe I want to come back to one of the things that you said at the 
beginning is like, well, I will definitely reach out, but do you see yourself 
reaching out as the person that gets this critique?
Or is it like you're a senior engineer, right. So. Would you also reach out to 
the person, if you see they are leaving unkind comments from somebody, 

**Tomasz:** [00:16:34] I wouldn't be much more quicker to your child if it was, 
if it was somebody  because I have a feeling that as a, as a senior in the 
organization, that your job is not to only write code.
But your job is also make others more productive and also build an environment 
in which people are feeling okay to kind of express their ideas, express their 
concerns and whatnot. So if it doesn't happen for the architect, this, this 
thing that I've written about in the article, it happened years ago, and it 
doesn't do the, have them in my current company, which is something that I'm 
very happy to see.
But nevertheless, if I were to see a situation in which somebody more senior. Is 
kind of attacking a more junior engineer in the code review. I will definitely 
reach out to do that reviewer saying, but this is not okay. This is not 
something that we do, because think about it. Some people are not used to 
culture.
This culture is, are very public. And it doesn't make people excuse necessarily 
the good that I am. You know, I've just started at this company two weeks ago 
and now I have a bunch of quests with like 50 comments in it. Maybe I'm a fraud. 
Maybe I shouldn't be hired through the first day. Like this is not the kind of 
environment that you want to build in a software organization.

**Michaela:**   [00:17:54] Yeah, I think he had talking about a lot of different 
things here. And one is for example, that the context that you have when you're 
doing code reviews, right? So this person, you were talking about a person 
that's just starting. So this person probably needs something very different in 
a code review than a person that's, you know, At the stable at this company 
already, or have found their place in this company and the team, for example.
And so, yeah, you're, you're totally right. There's so many different things 
that influence that. And so when I work with, with engineers on contributes and 
they are telling me those, or, you know, sometimes people are afraid even to, to 
tell that, but somehow it's surfaces, right? And they say, well, contributes is 
the problem.
But I really think it's not the country is that other problem is the team 
culture. So if things like this happen, In controversy then it's not the culture 
base. It's the culture is surfacing that. And I think on one hand, this is even 
good because now you can see it, right. You can see things that are happening in 
a more subtle way in meetings and, you know, in work coordinations or 
collaborations, you know, who reaches out to whom and how do you give, you know, 
orders or things like this.
So in hierarchical organizations, Well, so I know something else that I wanted 
to talk with you about and that's technical debt. And so I know that your 
organization is doing something specific here. Can you tell me a little bit, how 
are you tackling technical dev and you know, how you're working on it?
Do you say well happens and we never look at it and close our eyes? Or what are 
the strategies that you, that you have 

**Tomasz:** [00:19:21] here? Okay. So first of all, if any of that software 
organization is saying that they don't have technical depth, they're absolutely 
lying. Everybody has technical that including, including us for the record.
So from my own perspective, I'm very happy to be in a somewhat Greenfield 
project. So we don't have a lot of tech depth, mostly because we are building, 
you know, completing new features and functionality on top of existing stack. 
Bob. Nevertheless, we are also integrating with something that was certain, that 
some of it is definitely technical debt.
So there are a couple of things that we have been doing so far in order to 
address, because we have to continue. We have to continue to development ways to 
continue building experiences for our users, but we have to be able to do some 
of the fast. And when technical debt is high enough, you cannot do it anymore.
So we having this concept of a wall. And this is something that we did a bunch 
of times, and we basically about two types of worms. So first up we have those 
forums where you get together a group of engineers who are interested in a 
certain area. So for instance, I dunno, we have problems with our, this, or we 
have problems in our front end performance.
We've brought together a group of engineers who are interested in that and they 
will be able to help. So they would be not like full-time bidding on new 
features and experiences, but some part of the work versus like 50% will it be 
spent, you know, focusing on fixing technical debt in order to unlock everybody.
But we also had a case in which we are functioning, that they had to stop. And 
we had a, basically like a company, maybe not necessarily a company wide, but 
department wide, a worm. By this, we were not working on anything new for if I 
remember correctly two weeks and we did manage to combat in massive portion of 
our tech debt.
And my takeaway from all of that is you have the activity plan for six executive 
for my money. This is not something that happens in the meantime. This is not 
because I, I work in on some teams and there was this idea about. Each sprint, 
we're going to spend 20% of our time on this, or are the words, what I think 
works so much better is to have dedicated time and dedicated people who are 
passionate about, you know, fixing technical debt in my, in my humble opinion, 
the best way to address, for instance, like performance issues is to gather.
For engineers who are passionate about performance and leave them alone for two 
weeks, he will be very much surprised with the results. 

**Michaela:**   [00:22:06] Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And it, it becomes, suddenly 
becomes a project, right? It's not like something that you have to fix on the 
side, which is, you know, in your way and actually distracting you from 
something.
And it's also achievement. Like if you give them, this is a project then, and 
it's achievement that you can achieve and it not something like, Oh, you haven't 
worked on that feature. Well, I did something, you know, but because you're 
always like, it like drops that you're putting, right. So you don't see them, 
they are dropping and, you know, like on a stone and it's so hot that you don't 
see the drop, right.
So you really have to have a drain that the stone somehow cools down, which also 
reminds me on automatic for examples. I had like life singer on my show. And he 
was talking about automatic and day. What they do is they stop feature work for, 
I forgot the timing, but it's, it's impressive. And they just do technical 
death, right.
Just to just do everything that they didn't do before. And they also get so much 
done. And it's the whole company. Everybody does this now, and this is our 
number one priority. And yet he also said that it's really helping a lot because 
you know, you have this focus, you have this dedication and it's not like a 
distraction on the side that nobody was ready to take on.
So when I looked at your LinkedIn profile, I not only saw, you know, where 
you're working at right now, but I also saw a list of things that you're doing. 
Outside of work or, you know, partially at work or whatnot. Right. So you're 
also an egghead instructor. And I think I remember correctly, you said like you 
have 150 videos or something, is that correct?

**Tomasz:** [00:23:38] 170. 

**Michaela:**   [00:23:40] Wow. 170. So how are you doing that? Like, this is 
something that fascinates me and I just have to get more time and get better at 
all of those, you know, recordings. Staffing things like this, but this is 
definitely something that I aspire to do as well. How do you do this videos? You 
know, what, what motivates you to do them?
How did you become a head instructor? And yeah. Can you tell me a little bit 
about that? 

**Tomasz:** [00:24:03] So, first of all, I was not aware they're recording 
videos before I started in a bit as an insect or I was doing, I was trying to 
think of my blog. I was doing contract talks. And that is basically how I got 
noticed, because people have basically noted that I have a way of kind of 
teaching people what I know and I'm passionate about, you know, teaching 
basically everything that I know that that is kind of my, one of my personal 
goals is just as much as, as from what I know with others.
When it comes to recording over 170 videos, I recorded one video, then I did it 
again. Then I did it again. Then I did that again, because this is how you get 
to, to this kind of level. I was upsetting, not planning on the coding. So many 
videos when I founded two years ago, nearly to the day two years ago. I remember 
the very beginning I had a F I had this feeling, but what am I going to record?
I have nothing to teach. Um, this is not exactly true. I think that if you have 
non trigger experience as a developer with defense, they have something to teach 
others. And if you are, if you have this feeling that you have definitely 
nothing more to teach, well, this is a good time for you to learn something new.
And I found myself that I learned the best bio teaching. So the best way to, for 
me to solidify it's something that I've learned recently is to write a blog post 
about this.

**Michaela:**   [00:25:37] And so you do it from a, from a work from, yeah. From 
a book process perspective. Do you write a blog post first and then you make the 
video or do you make a video first or you just make videos for things that you 
think that are better covered in a video and you write a blog post for things 
that you think better are covered in a blog post.

**Tomasz:** [00:25:57] That's a good question. What I basically do when I want 
to share something with others. I mostly tried to think, what would it be useful 
to me? Because like some concepts are amazingly well explained as a blog post 
because, because you can search through it and whatnot, some topics are better 
when it comes to video.
So for instance, if I were to, I have a book post on my, on my screen and I saw, 
uh, I was watching this amazing talk about coconut cookies, tokens and API is 
kind of, is in depth, dive into, into those topics. And that was doing some 
notes and basically  that I published yesterday. So this is, this is good.
This works great as a blog post, because a video of me doing this content is no 
better than the conference talk that I've just watched. But if I were to try to 
expend something that is a bit more visual. So how do you do something in AWS 
console? Then the video works somewhat better than this. 

**Michaela:**   [00:26:54] Yeah. Yeah.
And so you just said AWS, so I noted you're are AWS certified. What do you do 
there? How did you, you know, was it a requirement from your job or why did you 
set out to do that certification? And I also started, you're going to the next 
level from AWS certified and yeah. What motivates you to do that? 

**Tomasz:** [00:27:16] So there are two things here.
So first of all, all ex has been largely, I mean, all it's basically on the 
books. We have migrated everything to AWS. I think like two years ago, my team, 
we are working with weather stock, which is based in AWS. So we have API 
gateways. We have Lambda functions. We are using dynamo DB as storage as QS. So 
there's lots of different diverse services.
And I've joined today, a company as a front-end engineer. And I am still a 
front-end here, but when I joined, I had. No idea about data. I, it was 
completely agreed in that area. So after a while, my manager and encouraged me 
to learn more about this, because the idea was, if you want to be able to 
contribute more, if you want to be able to contribute to the technical 
discussions that you have to architecture decisions, you should probably know 
what is going on.
And getting certified is a. It's a good way to accomplish that for two reasons, 
because there's this texture system of learning to become a certified, because 
there are there's physical lists of topics that you have to be knowledgeable in, 
in order to pass the exam. Right? So you have the sector idea of what do I need 
to learn as opposed to, I'm going to learn everything, because this is not 
viable with AWS.
And secondly, you have some sort of a proof that you have at least vaguely. 
Vague idea of what you are talking about when it comes to. And like I said, in 
10 days from now, I am going to pass my another example. So this is the AWS 
developer and I sure hope I'm going to pass it because this episode is going to 
be live.

**Michaela:**   [00:29:01] Yeah, it could be. Yeah. So yeah. And well, one of 
the, the, the question that comes to my mind, you said, well, when I joined all 
Alex, I was a front end engineer. I'm still a front end engineer. But at that 
point, I didn't know, AWS. I guess in their job posting, I don't know. Maybe you 
reacted to that or I don't know how you were hired or how you were, you know, 
getting, getting information that there is this description.
Maybe they, they said you should know AWS, or it's preferred that, you know, 
it's something like this. And how do you, you know, how do you communicate that? 
Can you tell me a little bit about your hiring experience? You know, and you 
know, what questions were you asked? How was that process going? And, yeah, that 
would be interesting.

**Tomasz:** [00:29:46] So the fun thing is that I've joined two and a half years 
ago. And I haven't been in that I've joined a somewhat different company because 
we are, you know, changing and growing quite, quite rapidly. So, I mean, I can 
talk about the process that we have today because I am also kind of involved in 
the hiring process because I'm interviewing somebody basically every week.
But nevertheless, when it comes back to AWS for us plus fountain. We absolutely 
do not expect trans engineers to have AWS experience. I wanted to throw down 
something new. I want it to grow. This is why I am interested in investing in 
that area. Nevertheless, I do a command to keep your eyes open. Like we don't 
explicitly expect, expect the best experience, but nevertheless, it is useful.
But when it comes to hiring process itself, we have a bunch of interviews. And 
our hiring process. So from my kind of technical perspective, we have two types 
of interviews. So there was a strictly technical interview in which we are now 
talking about somebodies experiences. We are also kind of getting into some 
topics when it comes to, to JavaScript, to react and whatnot.
And we also have a second interview, which is a system design interview. So the 
idea is that we give you a problem. An architectural problem. And we basically 
have this conversation about how would you solve that problem? What kind of 
technologies would you use? How would you use them? How would you test that?
How would you monitor monitor VAT? And so it's actually one of my favorites 
because he had to get to learn how other people are thinking about building 
software and, you know, Charlotte architectures and the just, I learned as much 
as, as they do on those interviews. 

**Michaela:**   [00:31:34] And so now you are at the company. Do you have like a 
career ladder there?
Do you have like some, you know, when I was working at Microsoft, there was like 
this really set in stone, things that you have to accomplish to get to the next 
level, you know, what should be your, you know, skills technically, you know, 
professionally and so on. How does that work at all 

**Tomasz:** [00:31:53] X. So we do have a, we have a career lover that is by I'm 
checking at the end into somewhat like a tree.
So there's junior there's mid level slash Aguilar engineer there, senior 
engineer. And after a senior engineer. So basically where I am there's this 
chain is going to branch out. So there's a manager stuff and there's an 
individual contributor path. So in the middle, just powerful can become an 
engineering manager afterwards.
You can become a head or director of engineering after work, probably a CTO or 
something. I'm not even thinking about this level right now on the individual 
contributor path. We have fleet engineers and principal engineers, and. Chief 
engineers if I remember correctly. So basically what we want to do is to avoid 
this problem that I saw at my very first company where you had senior developers 
who are promoted to engineer managers, not only not because they had, they had 
manager skills.
But you had to promote the subway. That that was the UNBC option. And some 
engineers are terrible managers because managers managing people. It's a 
completely different job than, you know, being a senior software engineer. 

**Michaela:**   [00:33:16] And so where do you want to go? Like you're now in 
this, you know, one step before, so when you're branching out, which direction 
will you go, where are you going to the management drought?
Or would you go into the lead engineer out? 

**Tomasz:** [00:33:27] They would have to go into the lead engineer out because 
I'm the kind of person who likes to make, make an impact in the organization, 
but mostly from like a technical perspective and mostly from the perspective of. 
How do we that software, how do we think about fountain?
How do we think about, you know, quality and whatnot? Because like all the 
components we have more to do as, as all companies we would like to improve and 
having, you know, people and having more people in those kinds of like 
leadership, technical leadership roles helps us can kind of gel with the picture 
of where we would actually be.
And I dunno, two years in five years and whatnot, I am not entirely sure whether 
I would be the best manager alive. Definitely not a remote manager. Maybe if 
this wasn't no, the year of 2020, where everybody's working there, mostly, that 
would be probably a different story. But as of, uh, as effect, now I am gearing 
towards the reef engineers patch.

**Michaela:**   [00:34:28] And so one of the things that when I hear you 
talking, right, it feels like you're very involved in the decisions that are 
made about, you know, for example, well, how do we tackle technical debt? Right. 
Do we do this more rooms? Are people involved in those discussions about, you 
know, how do we actually.
Build our culture internally. How do we, and especially obviously also, uh, 
engineering, right? What role does Cody we have for us? Is that something that 
you feel that you can actively change? Or is it something that others are 
thinking about and your are adopting it? 

**Tomasz:** [00:35:01] So we have, we have a couple of company values and two of 
them are my favorites.
So the first one is be open and the second one is to take ownership. And I 
imagined that the, because. Most kind of like senior engineers in our 
organization. Like we have this strong sense of ownership. So we are not 
building something in a bad way because I don't know somebody from higher above 
told us, do we want to build the best experiences that we, that we possibly can.
And if we feel like we should improve in some area, So for instance, well, I 
don't know, imagine that we were not doing cultures at all. And I thought we 
have a group of engineers who are saying, we want to do code reviews and we get 
to kind of influence our technical directors are very open to communication too, 
to discussion.
So it's not like there are no them all kinds of people that are very, you know, 
kind of eager and to not only do discuss, but also to listen to our feedback. 
And to improve and also grow, grow on each other. We also have this process of 
kind of like a request for comments documents. So if you, as an engineer, if you 
feel like somebody, something is not 100%, okay.
Like there are some processes that could be improved. You can always, I document 
ask other for feedback. And maybe like this document is going to become 
basically the way we do bad things from now on at all. Like. 

**Michaela:**   [00:36:38] Yeah. So one of the things that I know is your area 
is somehow testing. And I know that you, I mean, I asked that question today on 
Twitter.
You know, what people want me to ask you? And testing was one of the things and 
they said, well, yeah, you're doing testing. If your skills are not really good.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit more about your philosophy 
here? So 

**Tomasz:** [00:37:04] my philosophy when it comes to testing is that I want to 
sleep better at night. I don't want to worry about my changes back in 
production. I am not brave enough to push major features to production that they 
don't have pets basically.
So when it comes to that, I struggled to believe that something that is not 
tested is not done. And this tweet that you are referring to is from my 
colleague of mine Yens. Right. And we have this internal job that's tests. So 
down development, because if you build a feature and you're, I did the test, it 
is twice the work.
Right. But imagine that you are building a house. You could probably no visits, 
pasta, which, you know, having cheaper materials, maybe those, wait, wait, maybe 
you shouldn't wait this long for the concrete, you know, to, to finish like 
whatever the concrete is doing. If you know what I mean, maybe it is a better 
idea to have solid foundations on how we build software and then to kind of 
improve upon them.
Because my own impression after working here for two and half year is about. We 
are building websites and experiences for huge number of people. All that's in 
Poland is in top 10, most visited websites in this country. My mom is using goal 
ALEKS. I do get to beg production on some, like, you know, obvious mistakes 
because production incidents will happen always.
But I have a feeling that as engineers, we kind of get to choose what kind of 
productions incidents are not going to happen at all, because we've managed to. 
Test and make sure that I don't know, it is not possible for our login page to 
be empty. 

**Michaela:**   [00:38:49] Yeah. And I also think, I mean, Slowing down. I think 
it's a, it's a little bit a wrong perception because you're not only writing 
code.
Right. So there's this task that you're writing code, but an actually code lives 
on. Right. So, and you wanted to have it live on for a long time. And so if you 
think like this is the first investment that you're making, and then based on 
this investment, you're profiting from it. Right. But by your profit thing, you 
actually have to maintain.
The code. And so if you're, as you said, if you're building a better foundation 
and if you are adding tasks right in, you know, your foundation is actually good 
in the long run, you will have less iteration on, you know, maintaining that 
thing to improve it, to fix things that are broken or wrong. And so I think in 
the end, it amortize it itself over time.
Very, very quickly. Yeah. So yeah, definitely. I think that's true. So one of 
the things that you also mentioned was product. Driven mindset. What is it? 
Product driven mindset. And you know, how can we get that? 

**Tomasz:** [00:39:51] Sure. So the way I think about it is my job is not to 
push tickets in JIRA for them to do to them.
My job is to build products. I saw the way I think about it is as an engineer. I 
think that the best part of our ability by people who have this great 
understanding of what exactly are they building. And this is sometimes referred 
to as business context. So I don't know, I am not adding this form to make my 
manager happy.
I am adding this form so that our users can either know their bank account 
number to their account. But when you go one level above and think about what 
kinds of problems am I trying to solve? Then actually you are building by their 
father because it's not about the form. The form is the way we address an actual 
problem that our users have their actual needs.
So as an engineer, we might think, okay, why are we adding this form in the 
first place? Maybe we could do it in some other way. Maybe we could get this 
data from this other, I know Microsoft, it already has this data. Maybe we'll go 
to talk to people. And this probably different mindsets means, but you don't 
necessarily think about the structure of business in terms of, again, JIRA 
tickets, if you think about, okay, this is the problem that we are trying to 
solve.
How can we do that? Which maybe without even writing any code at all, because 
some problems can be solved by, I dunno, an email. I have a, I have this example 
that I often give. We had this idea that we wanted to ask our users feedback on 
a certain feature. This feature was not used by many people. So we want them to 
kind of have a survey inside of this page, but then we decided that we are going 
to send an email to them because it took us 10 minutes and we get the, exactly 
the same kind of feedback that we had if we were to build a form or survey.

**Michaela:**   [00:41:47] Yeah. And so what came to my mind when you were 
talking about this, is that I think. I mean, there are definitely engineers that 
don't want, or don't care so much about the product. And I, again, think it's 
not the engineer themselves. I think it's the culture in the company, right? 
That at one point you give it up maybe and just say, well, yeah, it doesn't 
actually met him.
What I think. So we just do what we are asked to because that's what we are 
incentivized for that, you know, that's what our incentive structure is all 
about. And, and I don't, I cannot change anything. Right. Even if I think this 
is not. The right step for the product. But I also think that sometimes there's 
like this business driven mindset, right?
So there are like those two things that are a little bit competing with each 
other, right? So there's this product driven mindset, which I think is maybe 
easier to adopt as an engineer because we like to create, and we maybe are even 
taught about, you know, how to think about the users and how, but then what's a 
little bit, even further away from an engineer.
Is this business driven mindset, right? So. Let's say a large corporation, 
right. And they wanted, they have like a tool and it's for code reviews. And so 
you have all these great ideas as engineers, how to improve this cult review 
tool. But there's this business aspect, which says, well, we are much bigger 
than contributes, right?
We are doing so much more. So right now we don't have to make the best product 
for code reviews. And so somehow this idea about, you know, making the best 
product com becomes a little bit diluted by, you know, the business goals that 
you have as well, which are not always the product goals. I don't know if this 
makes sense to you if you feel that as well, but is this something that I feel 
it.
Very often, very challenging and very de-motivating can also be very 
demotivating because I think, you know, there's, it's easy to fall in love with 
your product, right? It's a little bit harder to fall in love with business 
goal. 

**Tomasz:** [00:43:41] Exactly. I know, I know definitively what you mean 
because I can give you an example.
So we are running ads on all the, every large website is running ads. We are no 
exception and. Engineers are, you know, we, we don't like that. We don't like, 
you know, having other Sonos creeps that are loaded on our beautiful, 
beautifully crafted pages with Google ads or whatever. And then we get, you 
know, get informed that by the way, this is paying X percent of your salary 
because, you know, we are not putting those apps for, because we want to do 
right.
We are putting those ads because they help us, you know, our business and, you 
know, earn more money for the business. And I completely agree with you, but 
sometimes it is difficult to kind of figure it out. Why we should do a certain 
thing. And I think it's always important both in programming product and 
business, to try to figure out what do we optimize for a given moment, right?
So are we optimizing for growth in our user base? Are we optimizing for the best 
possible product or are we optimizing for the greatest revenue? Because doing 
all of those at the same time is actually impossible. Yeah. 


**Michaela:**   [00:44:57] Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. I find it always quite 
challenging, especially like all those, even though, you know, it, it's not 
pleasant.
Right. So even though, you know, okay. To add some out paying part of my salary, 
it's still not a pleasant feeling like, Oh, the performance goes down. That's 
horrible. Can we block it? Where's the ad blocker, right? Yeah, exactly. Right. 
Yeah. Yeah. So, well, I think we actually reached the end of our session today 
of the interview.
Is this something that you want to share with my listeners that we haven't 
touched on that you think would be important or something that you want to tell 
them? Some advice that you want to give them on their way? 

**Tomasz:** [00:45:41] Um, okay. So I had this, I had this thought yesterday 
because I'm not sure whether you are listening.
You know, you listen, if you're a student or if you are younger than me, 
apologies, I've thrown him the 30 this year. And this is a major moment for me. 
But I was thinking today about when I was studying at the university, I have a 
master's degree and electronics and communications. How somewhat this degree is 
to my career.
If you are studying for, in a computer science degree, you were probably going 
to become a developer and some of those skills are going to be useful. But 
nevertheless, I w I wanted to kind of express this idea that if you are in a 
college, if you are, if you basically should have chosen our own Pedro for, for 
a certain, you have ended up.
I have this strong feeling that as you know, your university is basically not 
kind of like defining points of your life. I am struggling to name like most of 
the names of my professors from the university, not to mention the kind of the 
content of the class that they thought I am a JavaScript developer, and I didn't 
write a single line of JavaScript during my inner negativity.
So this was something that I would love to share. 

**Michaela:**   [00:47:01] Yeah. And I also think that there's always a point to 
change, right? I mean, if you look at my, if you look at my path, there was a 
big. A big turning point that people would probably say, well, that's the big 
turning point, right? There's when I finished art school and I went on to do 
computer science.
Right. And I didn't have an idea about computers. And so maybe that was, it 
seems like this is a turning point, a huge turning point, but actually it's not, 
it wasn't really like this huge turning point. When I started from computer 
science to software engineering, right. When I made this switch was again, It 
was probably the same turning point, right.
When I then went to, you know, do for my first job was again, a very different, 
you know, experience when I worked as a researcher and actually over the years, 
you know, things really. They get less, less important and still, you know, 
every time you do something new, it's again, it feels like, Oh my God, can I do 
that?
Right. It feels like, Oh, this is what I, so when I stopped my research position 
and people were telling me, you're completely crazy that you do that, right. Who 
would give up this position? And it felt crazy. And it felt like, Oh my God, you 
know, like what now? And now it's. One year later. Right. And I feel like, well, 
it completely changed again.
And so I think it's always, when we are in the situation, we feel like, Oh, this 
is now so important, right. This is such a defining moment for my life. But 
actually we can always change. I mean, even if you don't have a computer. 
Science degree or no university degree, you can actually really change. And 
it's, it's a lot about imposter syndrome.
Also, maybe getting over, you know, yourself and you know, your, your feelings 
or your thoughts in your head that tell you you're not good at that, or because 
you don't know it. Right. You don't know it. And I started my business. My first 
intention was I have to do an MBA, right. To be prepared. Let's do an MBA 
because somehow, you know, this gives you some security that you know what 
you're doing, but I felt like, well, this takes way too long and too much money.
Right. I don't have it. So I have to just figure it out myself. And I think 
every step that you're doing, even if you're not, let's say you are, you know, 
in the fast food industry. And now you think I want to become also a JavaScript 
engineer or developer. It feels really unreal and impossible right now, but 
really this small steps that I think maybe just brings me back to what you said 
about your videos.
Right. I made one video and another video and another video. Right. And then you 
look back and it like it's two years later. It's probably another overnight 
success, right? You're not waking up, you know, watching one YouTube video, 
writing your first website, and then the next day you are, you know, you, you 
accomplished your dream, but if you, every day, you know, work on that, I think.
Yeah. And don't let you know whatever happens right now. Define you. I think we 
are. Giving too much, much, too much weight to what's in the now. Right. Which 
is important on one hand. But you know, it, yeah. It, it, it becomes less and 
less important over the years. So I totally agree. Yeah. 

**Tomasz:** [00:50:07] I was, I was still supposed to tell this story because 
this was requested on Twitter.
And I think it plays very nicely to what we just talked about. I went skydiving 
for the very first time this year, because as I mentioned, I've done 30, my wife 
decided to, to attempt, you know, connect me. Therefore she booked out a 
skydiving session. Luckily I did get the parachute. So that was actually 
excellent.
But the reason why I'm mentioning this is that it was absolutely scary, but the 
scariest moment was the night before. I was unable to see if I was in the lane, 
in my bed. I was going through the sky dive over and over in my head, even 
though I had absolutely no idea what to do. I, you know, I watched a video on 
YouTube.
So I have this vague idea of, you know, I'm going to get into an airplane. We're 
going to fly up and then they're not going to jump out of a freaking moving 
airplane. But when I actually got there to the airport, Then I realized that, 
you know, some other people are also doing this and there are not dying, 
therefore I am going to be okay.
So I think this is a huge, important lighters. And for me, it's about this 
courage moment when you are trying to make a huge impact, a huge change is okay 
before you make them. Because as soon as it gets to work, as soon as you 
actually get started, it becomes. So much easier. It doesn't mean that it is 
going to be easy, but it is going to be easier.
And with each kind of like additional challenges that you overcome, like those 
things have a good chance of getting easier. But going back to my actual videos, 
I struggled a lot because the, my very first, like five or 10 videos, that was a 
hustle. And honestly it took me three hours to record a two minute video.
That was a disaster. I thought I am so much better than at this, but it took me, 
it took me awhile. So you have to, basically, I would recommend that, you know, 
you should always try to kind of keep him for away and go out of your comfort 
zone. And every once in a while, if she feels, it feels like it. Uh, I think, 
you know, this is a good idea.


**Michaela:**   [00:52:19] Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. That's, that's 
definitely, that's definitely true. So, well, I think that's a, it's a perfect 
ending. Thank you so much, Thomas, for being on my show and spending the time 
with me and telling me so much about, you know, how it is to be a software 
engineer at your company. And yeah.
Thank you so much. Thank 

**Tomasz:** [00:52:38] you very much for having me. That was a pleasure. 

**Michaela:**   [00:52:40] Yeah, it was my pleasure. Okay. Bye bye.
